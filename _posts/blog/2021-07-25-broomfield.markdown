This week, we took it easy since the whole state is full of
smoke from [bootleg fires](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/20/1018522825/bootleg-wildfire-forest-management)
on the west coast. Instead of doing a weekend in the mountains, we
just took a small trip on Sunday on some trails in a nearby town.

# Broomfield Open Space

Broomfield contains a ridiculous number of intersecting trails, so
we followed a route that took us through a smattering of those trails.
We spent time on the [coal creek trail](https://www.bouldercounty.org/open-space/parks-and-trails/coal-creek-trail/), [rock creek trail](https://www.bouldercounty.org/open-space/parks-and-trails/rock-creek-trail/),
[meadowlark trail](https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7005062/meadowlark-trail),
and the [US 36 Bikeway](https://commutingsolutions.org/bike/us-36-bikeway/).

The trails were all really nice, though the smoke sort of ruined the views
and made the entire ride feel like [scenes in Mexico in Breaking Bad](https://old.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/gwbsyx/is_mexico_really_yellow/).
The mix of gravel, concrete, and "singletrack" kept us entertained and even
though some sections of the trail were a bit busy, other sections were
empty enough that we could ride side-by-side and hang out on the bikes for
long periods of time.

I recently invested in a new helmet and some new brakes for Mandarb. I ordered
them both from [Planet X](https://www.planetx.co.uk/), a bike accessory seller
in the UK with obnoxiously low prices that actually made it worthwhile to pay the shipping fees from England instead of a US merchant. Overall my purchases turned out well, but keep in mind that covid still has US and UK customs
utterly borked so if you order from them, expect your shipment to hang out in
Los Angeles for a couple of weeks with no update from UPS.

# Four Noses

After the ride, Meg and I stopped by the nearby [4 Noses](https://www.4nosesbrewing.com/) brewery for a drink, food, and some to-go cans.
We've purchased from 4 Noses before, since they distribute a little bit around
the Front Range, but this was the first time I've actually been to their brewery
for a drink. Turns out, they've got a fantastic location. I'm excited to bike
all the way to 4 Noses from Denver sometime, since they're located just up the
street from [Kokopelli](http://kokopellibeerco.com/), which we've biked to
before.

# Conclusion

It was nice to spend a weekend relaxing at home, without figuring out a place
to sleep overnight or how to best avoid traffic into the mountains. But since
Meg and I only have a couple of weeks left before we head back to the northeast
for a late-summer family trip, I'm sure we'll end up doing some more bike rides
in the mountains soon. As long as the fires don't deteriorate air quality past
the point of human safety.
