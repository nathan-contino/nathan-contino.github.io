The last few weeks and weekends have been busy. We:

- travelled from Colorado to Virginia to visit family
- subsequently headed up to Central New York to visit even more family
- visited Northern New York to visit yet more family
- completed a number of bike rides on the nice, flat, sometimes humid Erie Canal Trail in New York.

It's been rad. But it hasn't been vacation. More "long-awaited family visits."
This weekend, Meg and I finally got back into the grind
of just-us vacation. Also known as the gravel grind.

# Lumpy Country

Our journey began from the Syracuse area on Friday. The route on major
highways was pretty inefficient, so we cut the hypoteneuse through the Adirondacks for our drive to Vermont, a nice break from
our many hours of highway driving on the CO -> VA -> NY route. Many
deer sightings, farm stands, cute diners, and slow drivers later,
we arrived at our first destination: [Ranch Camp](https://ranchcampvt.com/).
(In case this link ever breaks, their slogan is "Bikes. Beers. Burritos.")
After a craft beer from New England and a burrito with maple verde salsa, we
were ready for the last leg of our journey: less than an hour of beautiful
driving through northern Vermont.

For a second stop, we chose
[Hill Farmstead Brewery](https://hillfarmstead.com/), one
of the best craft breweries in... the world, I guess? It did not disappoint.
We grabbed a draft pour, split a bottle, and then picked up an outrageous
amount of cans and bottles to bring home and drink during our upcoming bike
ride. I don't think I can do Hill Farmstead justice with any words I write
in this post, so just know that if you love beer, it's worth visiting.
Everything is well executed, even styles of beer that you don't like are
worth tasting, and it's beautiful to boot. If you can pull off an IPA aged
in white wine barrels, you can pull off damn near anything.

After Hill Farmstead, our campsite was a very, very short drive away. Special
thanks to [HipCamp](https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US) for hooking us up
with a guaranteed campsite that has a dedicated outhouse for a reasonable
price. The land around our campsite was *especially* lumpy, presenting a bit
of a challenge for finding a flat tenting spot, but after we found a flat enough spot I really appreciated the views of the nearby cemetary, rolling
hills, and the cute farm animals. We dropped the car off there,
I swapped out my awful Onyx brake pads for some aftermarket
[Kool-Stop](http://www.koolstop.com/) upgrades,
and we set off on the bikes in search of dinner.

Our bike ride to dinner turned out amazing. Turns out that unlike other
Northeast states (New York, specifically), Vermont is chock full of
low-traffic dirt roads with low speed limits. That's pretty great for
bike rides. But the hills made me very glad to have upgraded my brake
pads. Eventually we made it to dinner at
[Blackbird Bistro](https://www.blackbirdbistrovt.com/). My review, in
short: good food. Solid poutine with sweet/creamy cheese curd. Fries
should not come with every sandwich, because two sandwiches + poutine +
fries for each sandwich was altogether too many potatoes. After this
meal I was thoroughly potatoed out. The beer selection was unusually
good.

After dinner, we took a slightly-less-hilly route back to the farm
camping site. Avoided a passing shower by sheltering under some
trees on the side of the road. Saw (and photographed) an impressive
double rainbow during a spectacular sunset after the passing shower.
Made it back to the campsite just before sunset, and shared a couple
of Hill Farmstead beers as we watched the sun set and the stars came
out.

# Pointy Country

The next morning, we woke up before the goats. about 7 AM. Drove across
the remainder of Vermont and a good chunk of New Hampshire to Gorham
to have breakfast sandwiches at a combination coffee shop/bookstore.

Does a coffee shop/bookstore combo make Gorham sound quaint? Don't be
fooled. Turns out, the city is fake-outdoorsy
[side-by-side hell](https://coloradosun.com/2021/06/17/off-highway-vehicles-conflict-colorado-mountains/) with lots of
fast food and motorcycles. Woof.

After a good deal of sadness and really loud rumbling from the many
passing side-by-sides, we got some coffee and sandwiches in our
systems and were ready to start our ride. After a brief stop at the
local Dollar General to pick up some ramen, toothbrushes (you always
forget one item on a trip like this), and a bowl, we got all of our
gear in the panniers and onto the bikes. We were all ready to set out.
Then we experienced a once-in-a-lifetime event: a visit from the local
crazy bicyclist. TOM (The Orange Man) was very friendly, and supposedly
a philosopher, and very into "living life in the now." We politely
listened to his thoughts on life and compliments of our orange shirt
choices and car. Then we headed out as quickly as we could to avoid
another 40-minute lecture.

After our first impressions of Gorham, we were really afraid that
our bike ride would be totally ruined by side-by-sides and ATVs.
Fortunately, our bike ride quickly took us out of town on New Hampshire's
[Presidential Rail Trail](https://www.nhstateparks.org/visit/recreational-rail-trails/presidential-recreational-rail-trail),
which let us enjoy the countryside far away from the noises of
cars and ATVs. In our 18 miles of riding, we saw miles of rocky mountain
creeks, cute former-rail bridges, bald mountain views, a
[wildlife sanctuary](https://www.nhaudubon.org/lands/sanctuaries/pondicherry-wildlife-sanctuary/), one or two people riding bicycles... and
at least a dozen e-bikes, mostly rentals. I guess New Hampshirians find
pedaling a bicycle challenging enough to need assistance most of the time.

After riding the entire length of the rail trail, we set out on some rural
roads to find dispersed camping. The journey began with a long, plodding
ascent of a poorly maintained paved road, continued with a speedy hill descent down the [Owl's Head Highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Route_115), and culminated with a long, steep climb up a hill
leading into
[White Mountain National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/whitemountain).

{% include figure.html url="sep_06_new_england/18_meg_hill_forest.webp" description="meg climbing her way into the white mountains" %}

Our search for dispersed camping at 4 PM on Saturday of Labor Day weekend
went better than expected. After quite a few occupied campsites, most of which
were suspiciously devoid of humans, we found a campsite with no tent set up,
a plastic bag over the site marker, and a Ford F-150 parked across from the
campsite parking spot. Since there were only two more campsites, both of
which we figured were occupied, we parked the bikes and settled in, prepared
to ask the owner of the truck if we could camp in a corner of his site when
he returned. The owner never ended up camping in the site, and someone finally
stopped by to pick up the truck around 8:30 PM, well after dark. Which just
makes me more curious why anybody would leave their truck parked in a national
forest next to a campsite they don't intend to use. But on the plus side, we got a campsite!

{% include figure.html url="sep_06_new_england/19_meg_camp.webp" description="we got a campsite on labor day!" %}

The campsite was largely uneventful, except for one thing: at 9PM, for a good
half hour, the air exploded. BANG BANG BANG, one after another, for thirty minutes straight. Woke me right up and kept me up until it ended. I still don't
know for sure what it was, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't fireworks because
I didn't hear any telltale fireworks noises, so my only conclusion is that
somebody illegally used the national forest as their personal shooting range.
Such is life in the US, I guess.

We were also woken up around 10PM by somebody shining a flashlight around our
campsite to see if it was occupied, which leads to yet more questions. Who is
still looking for a campsite at 10PM when the sun sets at 7:15? How am I supposed to signal that my campsite is occupied when I don't have a vehicle
to park outside of it? The world may never know.

After the flashlight, F150, and explosions, the night was uneventful. Meg and I
woke up in the morning, made some coffee and oatmeal, and packed up the gear.
Once I was 100% sure we were ready to go, Meg noticed that I had a flat tire.
I took a chance and pumped it full of air, and since it seemed to hold, we
continued on our ride, eying the formerly-flat tire suspiciously.

The day started off well, with a quick mile descent on the dirt road to a
gas station. We nabbed a lemon poppyseed muffin and some water, hit the
bathroom, and headed on our way down another paved road to the next stage of
the ride, a long hill ascent to
[Jefferson Notch](https://trailsnh.com/reports/Forest-Roads-Gates.php?road=jefferson-notch-road),
the highest point along any public road in New Hampshire.

This hill climb was long, but a lot easier than the climb to our
campsite the previous day due to the rolling nature of the hills and the
fact that we hadn't already spent hours slowly pedaling uphill along a rail
trail. After the hill climb, we were rewarded with an exhilarating 6 mile downhill ride back to the rail trail, which took us right back to Gorham.
A quick stop for some poutine in Littleton later,
we headed back to New York State, overcast skies, and rain.

# Conclusion

New England impressed me. I spent a good deal of time in the Adirondacks and
upstate New York in general growing up, so I had some preconceived notions of
what Vermont and New Hampshire would be like for late summer outdoor activities.
Turns out, Vermont has a hugely different feel from New York, which is hugely different from New Hampshire. The low speed limits, dirt roads, liveable small
towns, and farm stands really impressed me. And the
[maple creamees](https://newengland.com/today/travel/vermont/maple-creemee/) really impressed Meg, our resident soft serve ice cream fan.
