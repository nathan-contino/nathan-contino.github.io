For the last week, Meg and I took a week off to appreciate Colorado
on weekdays. It seems like everybody loves doing the same outdoor stuff
in the mountains here, so taking a few days off to avoid the weekend
crowds makes a massive difference in *actually enjoying* the state.

We had quite the adventure.

# Day 1: Arapahoe Basin

Our ski week started with a Monday at
[Arapahoe Basin](https://www.arapahoebasin.com/), Colorado's least
soulless mountain. A Basin has it all: reasonably priced, decent
Bloody Marys; crazy terrain that even scares seasoned skiiers like
myself and Meg; no awful million-dollar studio condos; a crowd that
leans more "high ski bum" than "Californian millionaire on vacation";
and a peak that's over 13,000 feet.

It's my very favorite mountain on the I70 corridor.

Monday was a perfect blue-sky Colorado day. Light wind, barely a cloud in
the sky, and a sun so strong you could hang out on the deck in a t-shirt.
The morning started out a little icy, but quickly softened up to a point
where all the moguls and groomers were comfy to ride down. We ventured
into the glades just once, but it was so icy it just wasn't worth the
risk to life, limb, and our already-dull edges.

I forgot to mention one of my favorite parts of A Basin: the food. For
a non-crazy price, Meg and I split an entire (very large) tray of chicken
fingers, waffle fries, and a bowl of chili to dip them in. If you haven't
tried dipping chicken fingers in chili, you're missing out. It's best on a mountain.

We wrapped up our day in the early afternoon, and cruised over to
Outer Range brewing for an afternoon beverage. They might not serve the
most complex brews in the mountains, but if you want a hazy IPA, they know
what they're doing. Just avoid the sours.

After Outer Range, we headed up to Steamboat Springs for our rental
and the next stage of our vacation: hot tubbing and skiing, day in and
day out.

# Day 2: Steamboat

Our rental condo was mere steps away from the Thunderhead
lift at Steamboat, so we started out our morning early on some groomers.
Conditions were decent, but a little icy. We made our way
up the mountain to
[Morningside Park](https://coloradoskiauthority.com/steamboat/morningside/),
a bowl that's chock full of glades and blues. Bonus: all of the trails
use breakfasty names like "Cheesy Grits", "Wake Up Call", "Biscuits",
and "Huevos". As the snow softened up, the glades became more and more fun,
but also more and more busy. We didn't end up catching the last lift or anything, but I'd say we got a pretty solid day of skiing on the mountain.

{% include figure.html url="feb_2022_steamboat/06_steamboat_clear_skies.jpg" description="checking out the view for the only day we'd be able to see it" %}

The day ended with a modest amount of snowflakes, hinting that we might
just get some much-needed snow overnight. We had a beer, a pizza, and a
crazy good beet salad (seriously) at a favorite from our last Steamboat
visit, [Mountain Tap Brewing](https://www.mountaintapbrewery.com/).

# Day 3: Steamboat Pow Day

We woke up on Wednesday to a brilliant sight: inches of fresh snow, and
more coming down. It wasn't hard to get ourselves to the lift
a bit before opening time, and we must have looked so psyched for the
powder that the liftie took mercy on us and let us up a few minutes early.
We ascended up the mountain into what could be best described as... white.
Maybe 50 feet of visibility, inches of powder on the groomers, and
the glades in Morningside were chock full of fluffy, fluffy snow. It was
nothing short of spectacular.

{% include figure.html url="feb_2022_steamboat/12_cheesy_grits.jpg" description="damn those grits were cheesy" %}

We circuited Morningside for a couple of
hours, until the line started to get really busy and disorganized, and
then started to explore the glades on the middle-front side, where the
lifts had essentially no lines. I couldn't believe it, but those glades
were even *better*, and had less traffic to boot.

{% include figure.html url="feb_2022_steamboat/13_pow_trees.jpg" description="trees and pow and pow and trees" %}

Fresh tracks every time we headed down the mountain, even
when repeating the same glade back-to-back, and my first experience
skiing aspen glades. We even spotted an ermine (a sure sign of good luck)!

{% include figure.html url="feb_2022_steamboat/08_ermine_friend.jpg" description="hello friend!" %}

We skiied the absolute hell out of Wednesday, and drained just about every
minute we could out of the ski day. Conditions were a blast, the hot
tub was well deserved after, the peak beers were delicious, and the
[Colorado Style Pizza](https://www.beaujos.com/locations/steamboat-springs/?utm_source=local&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb)...
well, it was kind of like shitty upstate NY pizza with honey for dipping
the crust. But it tasted damn good after a hard day of skiing through inches
and inches of powder.

# Day 4: ... Still A Steamboat Pow Day

Thursday's conditions were almost as good (maybe better on the groomers)
than Wednesday. The powder settled into a fairly solid upper layer on the
slopes, and you could make it down most runs in the morning without hearing
a single hardpack scrape. We once again explored the many many glades of
Morningside until things got busy, then switched to the frontside glades, which
were as amazing as they were the previous day.

{% include figure.html url="feb_2022_steamboat/16_elk_mountain.jpg" description="elk mountain peeking out from behind the clouds" %}

The only issue? By our third day at Steamboat, it became very, very clear
that the lodge design is... poor. We spent most of our time riding on the
Thunderhead/Morningside half of the mountain. The only lodge on that side
of the mountain isn't really a lodge, it's a sit-down restaurant. With a
very very tiny bathroom for each gender. And non-sit-down seating that's
less spacious than the tiny ski hill lodge I used to frequent back home,
[Dry Hill](http://skidryhill.com/trail-map/). This isn't just inadequate
for the amount of people on the hill (on a weekday!), it's incredibly
annoying to constantly wait in line *for the urinal*. Let alone trying to
warm up when there's no space and people are just giving up and
sitting on the ground in the hallway outside the bathroom. If anybody knows of
some secret lodge on that side of Steamboat with adequate bathroom space
and big tables to warm up and sip a hot cocoa at without a waiter... let
me know. But that was probably my biggest beef with Steamboat.

The crowds started to clog up the groomers and lift lines by early
afternoon, so Meg and I opted to recharge in the hot tub with beers
instead of fighting the traffic. After a few hours, we were ready to
get back on the slopes for a night of skiing under the lights on the
frontside. Night skiing turned out just as great as Meg and I
remembered from when we were in high school, and we had a great time
zooming down the slopes (with Olympians!). A margarita and a big plate
of nachos later, we headed (slightly stealthily) back uphill to our rental
on the side of a green run, since the local shuttle service apparently
doesn't extend to our condo. A beautiful walk, and a great workout besides.

# Day 5: Steamboat Pow Morning, Donut Afternoon

Our last day at Steamboat followed the same pattern as all of our previous
days: we skiied the Morningside glades until the crowds clogged up the lift, then we headed back down the frontside glades to Thunderhead to journey home.
We woke up to a very fine inch of powder, with more up the mountain, and the
glades felt just as good as they had for the last two days of powder. Our last
run down the mountain from nearly the top of Storm Peak all the way to
Thunderhead was very much the long way down, but ended up being pleasant
cooldown after days of thigh-and-calf-aching powder surfing.

After our couple of hours on the slopes, Meg and I had one final stop in
Steamboat: [Yampa Valley Kitchen](https://www.yampavalleykitchen.com/). Our
meal was just as delicious as our [previous meal]({% post_url /blog/2021-05-22-steamboat-springs-gravel-grinding %}), and Meg is happy to report
that her Cinnamon Toast Crunch Latte was just as she remembered it. (She *can*,
in fact, see why kids love it) After our
brunch, we headed straight back home to Denver over Rabbit Ears Pass, excited
to be back in our apartment after many days of skiing.

Unfortunately, Colorado had other plans.

# The Long Way Down

Right at the peak of
[Rabbit Ears Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_Ears_Pass), our car,
Clem, started yelling at us to consult our manual. As a naturally skeptical
person regarding all technology, I figured it was just a software bug, and
recommended that we ignore it. Fortunately cooler heads prevailed, and Meg
checked the tire pressure using the dashboard. Once we realized that our
rear passenger tire was rapidly losing pressure, I changed my tune and
recommended that we pull off *immediately*. Mountain passes might seem like
a shitty place to get a flat, but I have to admit: there are few places in
the country with as many pull-offs as Colorado mountain passes.

{% include figure.html url="feb_2022_steamboat/21_meg_unaware.jpg" description="meg is only happy because she doesn't know about the flat we will get in 20 minutes" %}

So we pulled off into a backcountry skiing parking lot and I opened my door
check the tire. A very, very loud HISSSSSSSSSSS informed me that our problem
was not just a software bug. In about 30 seconds flat I watched our tire turn
into a pancake, and not the tasty kind.

Fast-forward through about 5 minutes of debating the merits of roadside assistance vs. a tow truck vs. a roadside DIY repair, and Meg and I sprang into
action. We cleared out the trunk of ski supplies, lifted the damaged wheel, and
swapped our fresh pancake for an anemic donut (don't worry, we know all about
the [star pattern](https://www.tyreplex.com/news/how-to-tighten-lug-nuts-on-a-car-the-criss-cross-pattern/)). Not very many
minutes later, we were on our way to the nearest Subaru dealer in Dillon, around 60 miles away. I have to give Meg's dad, Craig, credit: I'm really,
really, really, really glad he taught us how to change a tire last summer.

{% include figure.html url="feb_2022_steamboat/22_flat.jpg" description="between meg removing the tire and nate working the jack, we made a pretty incredible pit crew" %}

Did you know that you're not supposed to exceed 50 miles per hour on a spare tire? It seems most Colorado residents don't. Even with our best efforts to
frequently pull off the road to let traffic by, it was amazing how many drivers
took our 50 MPH speed cap as a personal affront. I've never been honked at or
given the finger so many times in my life.

About 30 miles later, we made it to Kremmling, where we stopped at a gas station
to check on the donut. Sadly, their air pump lacked a gauge, so we skipped
topping off the donut's air to avoid accidentally overfilling it. At Kremmling,
we finally had reliable access to cell service, so I contacted the Subaru
dealer in Dillon to hook us up with a service time.

Another 30 miles of angry drivers, and we made it to Groove Subaru, just in
time for our appointment. Groove might just be my favorite Subaru dealer ever,
since they had it all: two dogs (one was a Bernese!), a ping-pong table where
Meg realized how embarrassingly bad I am at ping-pong, free coffee and granola bars, and some incredibly helpful and kind workers. We ended up waiting for an
hour or so while they fished a large piece of metal out of our tire. Then we
found out that they couldn't patch the tire. And they didn't have any
replacement tires, used or otherwise, that we could use to get home. So we did
what any reasonable person would do: asked them to fill up our donut to the
appropriate PSI, and headed out on I70 during a peak traffic time in the hopes
that we wouldn't exceed 50 MPH much during traffic anyway.

(Thanks Grace! We owe you a beer.)

(we were correct; most of the time, we were lucky to go faster than 30)

In the end, we made it home by 7 PM or so -- a testament to the buffer time
we left ourselves on the way home from skiing. Aside from one *highly*
aggressive yellow rental moving truck driver who very nearly honked and
rammed us off the road (despite adequate passing space on the left), it wasn't
too bad. We made it home safe, dragged our stuff back to the apartment, and
headed over to [Illegal Pete's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_Pete%27s)
for some much-deserved margaritas and burritos. Fortunately, the Friday night
peak burrito hour line gave us plenty of time to agonize over replacement tires
on our phones.
