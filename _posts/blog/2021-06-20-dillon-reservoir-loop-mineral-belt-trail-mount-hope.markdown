This weekend, Meg and I mixed hiking and biking instead of just
biking everywhere.

# Dillon Reservoir Loop

{% include figure.html url="june_20_trip/map.jpg" description="Dillon, Frisco, Silverthorne, and UNNAMED_MUNICIPALITY" %}

Our first stop was the [Dillon Reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillon_Reservoir),
where we enjoyed a quick coffee and a mostly relaxing 18-ish mile ride.
The Dillon Reservoir Loop is a (mostly offroad) trail that encircles
the entirety of Dillon Reservoir, passing through Dillon, Frisco,
and Silverthorne. Except for a 2-3 mile hill ascent along a road, the
entire loop is bike and pedestrian trail. Overall impression: it's
a nice trail. It crosses too many roads (particularly for a trail
that enscribes a reservoir -- why are there so many roads between the
trail and the reservoirâ€½). There are a lot of clueless e-bike riders
on it that do annoying things like pass you on the right without
announcing themselves, or stop right in the middle of the trail to
take pictures. The biggest hill in the whole loop is also the only
section that isn't a dedicated bike trail, so you get to enjoy the
delightful intersection of 7% grades alongside trucks and cars and
SUVs blasting right past your 2-foot bike path on the shoulder. But...
it's a beautiful trail. It's well-maintained. The views around the
reservoir are breathtaking. And it's mostly quiet and car-free. So
I'd recommend it only on weekdays and early weekend mornings.

# Mineral Belt Trail

{% include figure.html url="june_20_trip/different_viewz.jpg" description="as I said... different solid mountain views" %}

The Mineral Belt Trail is an 11.4 mile loop that starts in Leadville,
winds up into the surrounding foothills through some historic silver
mines, and finally returns back to civilization. It took up a small
chunk of the afternoon after looping around Dillon Reservoir and
having lunch in Leadville. The Mineral Belt Trail is less populated,
better maintained (it's extremely smooth pavement, with basically
no breakages anywhere), has just as pleasant (if different) views
as the Dillon Reservoir Loop... and it's full of plaques bearing fun
historic facts about mining in Leadville. There's a gradual but long
hill as you leave Leadville, but also a ton of fun downhill action
for several miles as you head into town. Overall my biggest complaint
about the Mineral Belt Trail is that it's just too short -- 11.4 miles
of pleasant riding goes by really quickly.

# Mount Hope

Mount Hope is the third almost-14er (that's "not quite 14,000 feet
tall" for those of you who aren't familiar with Colorado slang) that
Meg and I have summited. We specifically picked out this hike because
it's near a huge selection of dispersed camping sites, it involves a
rocky ridge hike with lots of scrambling opportunities, and it's not
a very popular hike, so we can actually enjoy nature instead of dealing
with people.

The initial portion of the hike was
really steep (which makes sense -- the ascent was only 3.7 miles total,
but took us from ~10,000 feet all the way to ~14,000 feet!), but really
unique in Colorado thanks to some VERY green and very wet forest at
the base of the mountain.

Our hard work paid off as we passed the treeline
around the midpoint of the hike, and we were treated to some spectacular
views of the many 14ers nearby.

Once we hit the ridge, the view opened up even more, and we could see
Leadville, Twin Lakes, Turquoise Lake, and basically the entire loop that we
biked a couple of weeks ago.

The ridge itself was some serious rock scrambling, with almost no path
whatsoever. After a few tricky spots and quite a few water breaks, we reached
the top, where we finally got to see 360-degree views of the surrounding
landscape.

The hike down the ridge was the trickiest part of the hike, but we managed
to make it down without incident. Lots of loose rocks and tricky spots, but
by keeping our pace slow and taking our time, we managed it. Special shoutout
to the spiders who occasionally set up their webs in the PERFECT spots to
descend, forcing me to reroute.

# Conclusion

Overall, another solid weekend. The mountains were a fantastic opportunity
to beat the [record heat wave](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/17/heat-wave-western-us-drought-fire)
that we're currently experiencing in Colorado. It was nice to get back into
hiking, even if it turns out that 4 miles of hiking is more stressful on your
muscles than 60 miles of biking.
