Meg and I just completed our longest self-supported bike tour yet: three
days of dirt roads, singletrack, surprisingly nice Vermont corner stores,
and Heady Topper. It was a lot of work, but such an incredible way to
see small towns and forests across Vermont. There's so much out there
that we've missed every time we've whizzed across the state in a car.

On bikes, it's so much easier to pull off to the side of the road to
dip your toes in a beautiful stream, or engage in a staring contest with
a deer or a porcupine, or debate eating a not-quite-ripe wild
strawberry. You end up seeing an area

# Day 0: Littleton->Brattleboro (by car)

Our route began just north of Brattleboro, in Dummerston. Since we live
a hundred miles away in Littleton, NH, we tossed the bikes onto our new
[1up](https://www.1up-usa.com/product-category/bike-racks/) rack and
made our way south to the starting point. As all good
[shirefolk]({% post_url blog/2022-05-24-live-free-or-die %}) do, we rise with
the sun, which is like 4:50 AM near the solstice. So it was pretty easy
to stop by the [Blue Sparrow](https://bluesparrowkitchen.com/) and enjoy
our first fantastic Vermont foodie experience of the weekend -- two high
quality breakfast sandwiches, a perfectly microfoamed latte, a just-a-tinge-sweet
cold brew, and a croissant and scone for later consumption on the bikes.
I am pleased to say that as fantastic as the Blue Sparrow is, it wasn't
even the best breakfast we ate on the trip. More on that later.

With full stomachs ready to fuel a long bike ride, we parked the car at
a park-and-ride by a covered bridge in Dummerston and set off over the
covered bridge on our first dirt road of the trip. First destination:
Brattleboro, a supremely touristy and surprisingly large Vermont town.

# Day 1: Brattleboro->Wilmington->Somerset Airfield

After our initial warmup on the relaxing dirt road, we ended up on a
somewhat busy paved arterial into Brattleboro. Since it was a Thursday
morning, traffic was light. Until we reached main street, which, in
classic summer Vermont style, sows unending confusion among the Massachusetts
tourists and backs up traffic for blocks and blocks. Fortunately when
you're riding a bike you can just hop off it and walk down the sidewalk.
Take that, car industrial complex!

*apple break time*


Our next stop was a quick snack break at [The Works](https://workscafe.com/locations/brattleboro/).
You know how your mother always told you that "if you don't have
anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"? Well I don't have much
to say about The Works. I certainly don't have anything to say about Meg's
iced chai latte, which appeared to be made of a 1:1 sugar:water ratio. I
damn sure don't have anything to say about my "latte", which literally
had no foam at all on it and tasted like a 50/50 combination of day old
burned coffee and overmicrowaved hazelnut creamer. I can say that our panini
was passable, though inconsistently microwaved enough to both burn my mouth
and still feature ice-cold sweet potato chunks. I can say that our bagel
tasted kind of like the free leftover bagel you'd get after a board meeting
at an insurance company.

![brattleboro](/../_images/june_26_vt/04_brattleboro.jpg)
*should have just gone to a brewery... never again "the works"*

All I'll say is this... I do not recommend "The Works" in Brattleboro.

After our exciting food critic experience in Brattleboro, it wasn't
long before we ended up back on windy dirt roads. Before long, those
dirt roads started to go up an awful lot. But with our Blue Sparrow
flaky-yet-soft-and-buttery croissant and delightfully-crumbly scone as
fuel, we soldiered up the hills and generally enjoyed hanging out in the
woods, saying hello to deer and porcupine, pointing out every tiny little
cemetary on the route, and de-stressing from the pains of 9-5 life. There
were so many stunning overlooks and cute houses on this section of the
route, you should probably just look at the pictures.

*lil salamander friend*

![nate dirt](/../_images/june_26_vt/07_nate_dirt.jpg)
*nate gravel grindin' on some quality vt dirt*

We stopped at a school in West Halifax to split an apple and
refill our water bottles. And a nearby cemetary to finish the aforementioned
insurance company board meeting bagel.

![bagel bridge](/../_images/june_26_vt/06_bagel_bridge.jpg)
*a great stop for a bagel*

A short time later, our route took us on VT 9 and VT 100, which eventually
led to ice cream and a Shaw's visit yielding beer and goldfish.

With ominous grey skies looming, we checked out dinner at the Maple Leaf
Tavern. It was generally a fine place, with a good beer selection and a
slightly pricey menu. But we were really distracted by the fellow who
stopped by after a "long day" for two to-go cups of vodka mixed with red
wine. I've had some long days myself, but... if you ever see me order
vodka mixed with red wine, call a doctor. Please.

![nate burger](/../_images/june_26_vt/08_nate_burger.jpg)
*a well earned burger*

We headed out from our burger-and-beer dinner with full stomachs and a
sense of unease at the somehow even-more-ominous and even-more-grey skies.
But our campsite was still miles away, and with bikes and dirt roads, it's
hard to say if you'll average 10 miles an hour or 2. So we donned our
raincoats and headed out.

![rainy bridge](/../_images/june_26_vt/09_rainy_bridge.jpg)
*high spirits despite the rain*

Sure enough, within just a few minutes we were biking down the side of
the road in a torrential downpour. But traffic was light, and after a
long sweaty uphill day, a shower wasn't the worst thing ever. We eventually
made it to forest road 71, a dirt road in absolutely supreme hardpack
condition, and rode along the river and past a cool bridge on our way
to the campsite at Somerset Airfield. We enjoyed a refreshing Heady Topper
as we set up the campsite and turned in for the night.

# Day 2: Somerset Airfield->Winhall Brook Campground

![camp day 1](/../_images/june_26_vt/14_camp_day_1.jpg)
*camp #1*

It rained on and off throughout the night, so Meg and I slept in a bit
Friday morning. By 9 or so, the sun started to poke out between the clouds,
so we dried off the tent and enjoyed some Clif bar breakfast. A group of
New Yorkers stopped by, and asked if we were done with the campsite --
Meg let them know that we were packing up and would be out in 10 or 15
minutes. So they idled their loud vehicles, drank their Monster, and
chain smoked cigarettes right next to our campsite while staring at us
as we packed up our panniers. That's probably the fastest I've ever packed
up our tent and panniers, but it somehow still felt like a very, very,
very long time.

![double track](/../_images/june_26_vt/12_double_track.jpg)
*starting day 2 with some quality double track*

After that awkward experience, we were happy to head over to some
technical doubletrack roads that giant RVs couldn't possibly traverse.
We enjoyed a morning of relative peace, enjoying the many beaver houses,
bogs, lone abandoned bus, and wildflowers with only the mosquitos and
horseflies to keep us company. Eventually, the route looped back to
forest road 71 and we once again enjoyed the supreme hardpack dirt roads --
a pleasant change of pace from the very rocky doubletrack we were just
riding. Sadly, great roads never last, and we were soon greeted by my
worst dirt road nightmare: resurfacing. Based on the smell, I can only
imagine that the national forest service is dumping loads of bog water
on the road to level it out. Based on the riding experience, I can only
imagine that the national forest service is actively attempting to make
riding a bike or motorcycle as unpleasant as possible by dumping super
loose dirt and tons of rocks all over the road. Hopefully the new material
will eventually settle down into nice hardpack again, but for now... it
was the worst riding experience of our whole trip. Thankfully it was just
a few miles, and mostly through very pretty forest. It did make us
appreciate all the other roads a lot more through contrast, I guess.

![bus](/../_images/june_26_vt/13_bus.jpg)
*luckily we took the long detour to see this sweet bus*

After a quick lunch break from the awful resurfaced road, we quickly
made a turn onto Forest Road 341, aka "International Paper Road", an 18.6
mile singletrack route around Stratton Mountain. With our fully loaded
panniers on our bicycles, I'm sure we looked a bit silly to the gravel
cyclist and guy hiking with his dog... but it was a really fun route.
Technically challenging enough to remain interesting, never so brutally
uphill to stop us completely, and with a long rewarding downhill stretch
at the end that took us nearly all the way to lunch.

*cleanin' off the feetsies*

For linner, we stopped in Winhall (or Rawsonville, or Jamaica?
Apparently nobody can agree on what this place is called) at the
[Workhorse Cafe](https://workhorse-cafe.business.site/).
I had a poke bowl that was both huge and well executed (especially for
someplace so far from the ocean!). Meg had a delectable bahn mi sandwich.
They had a decent beer selection to boot. Then we headed over via an
indirect (but happy cow adjacent) dirt road to the local beer store for
some Focal Banger, and Meg grabbed a quick chocolate/vanilla twist at
[Honeypie](https://www.orderathoneypie.com/)
because we apparently cannot go a single day without ice cream.

![green mountains](/../_images/june_26_vt/26_green_mountains.jpg)
*thanks to all of these darn trees in VT these are some of our only green mountain views*

Then, we headed off to our campsite. Our route took us along a dirt road
(big surprise) by the river, which eventually ended at somebody's driveway.
But our routing told us to continue straight, and sure enough, at the
end of the driveway we found a gate to an almost invisible ATV trail
right along the side of the river. We followed that for a few miles,
and eventually burst out of the woods in the middle of the Winhall
Brook Campground, where we surprised a random person by asking where we
could register for our campsite. Considering you have to pass the office
just to get into the campsite by car, this random person was very confused...
but eventually directed us up the (grueling) hill to the office, where
we checked in and got a campground map. It was still pretty early, so we
enjoyed some beers and waded in the river before we turned in for the
night. It was a great campsite except for the fact that we were woken
up by 30 minutes of loud, drunken Kelly Clarkson karaoke at midnight.

# Day 3: Winhall->Londonderry->Grafton->Brattleboro

By day 3, we were in prime bike touring mode. We woke up before 7,
ate a light breakfast, sunscreened and bug sprayed up, and were on our
bikes by 8. We set off on another
riverside ATV trail, and soon found ourselves at my favorite breakfast
of the trip -- [Corner Market Deli](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Deli/The-Corner-Market-Deli-124428001756232/) (sadly, their only internet
presence is a Facebook page). I enjoyed one of my favorite breakfast
burritos ever, Meg had a fantastic sausage-egg-cheese-biscuit sandwich,
they made a competent latte and a cold brew... and the staff was super
friendly and helpful, asking about our bike ride and letting us know
that we could buy singles of any of the four packs of beer in their cooler.
The guy at the counter seemed very impressed that we were riding all the
way to Brattleboro, indicating that the route was "waving hand motion."
I can confirm that there were a lot of hills. There was also some... very
Vermont-y eavesdropping to be had as various locals stopped in, ordered
their almond milk cold brews, and talked about the yard and personal farm
work they wanted to do. 10 out of 10 experience.

![breakfast](/../_images/june_26_vt/30_breakfast.jpg)
*shoutout to the corner market deli*

![pavement ends](/../_images/june_26_vt/31_pavement_ends.jpg)
*always a delight when you expect a busy road and it ends up being dirt*

![meg bridge](/../_images/june_26_vt/32_meg_bridge.jpg)
*one of many, many cute bridges*

After our quick stop in Londonderry, we headed down the many miles of
"winding gravel road" to Grafton, where we stopped at [MKT: Grafton](https://www.mktgrafton.com/).
This place was bougie compared to Londonderry, but damn was the food
great. We ate a donut first, then split an ice cold Heady Topper (despite it being 10:30 AM)
and a pesto-bacon-turkey-cheddar-romaine wrap. The donut was so good I bought a second one.
I still want to go back to buy some of the local cider and reisling they
had on display... and I didn't even bother going near the cheese display,
because I'm sure I would have bought pounds of cheese that would have
weighed my panniers down even more. One of the biggest downsides of bike
touring is the weight limitation.

![grafton](/../_images/june_26_vt/33_grafton.jpg)
*so much time to stop at all of the amazing local vt markets on our mostly downhill day*

![whoa](/../_images/june_26_vt/35_whoa.jpg)
*whoa*

![lily pond](/../_images/june_26_vt/36_lily_pond.jpg)
*so many lilies*

![close up lilies](/../_images/june_26_vt/37_close_up_lilies.jpg)
*close up lilies*

After Grafton, we continued down the road to a snacking spot by the river,
and eventually came to a crossroads: we could either take a cool dirt
road detour up a very large hill, or stay on the (not very busy) main road
and check out a farm stand that sells locally made ice cream. I'm sure
you've already guessed that we stayed on the main road and had some ice
cream. We even saw one of the cows that produces milk for the ice cream.
It was fantastic and absolutely worth it.

![picnic table](/../_images/june_26_vt/34_picnic_table.jpg)
*public parks in unexpected places are the best*

![ice cream barn](/../_images/june_26_vt/38_ice_cream_barn.jpg)
*the cows make the ice cream themselves*

![ice cream break](/../_images/june_26_vt/39_ice_cream_break.jpg)
*successfully ate ice cream all 3 days*

After ice cream, it was literally all downhill. We met another cyclist who
asked all about our trip and confidently introduced himself as Wayne Conway
(but probably not [this Wayne Conway](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1496778-Wayne-Conway)).
We swam in the river under a bridge and enjoyed a refreshing beverage. We
enjoyed our last taste of dirt roads. And then we got back to the car, where
the parking lot was literally completely full of Massachusetts plates, and
the river was chock full of Massachusites. And then when we headed back to
Meg's parents, the roads and towns were full of Massachusites...

![meg nate river](/../_images/june_26_vt/39_meg_nate_river.jpg)
*a well deserved swim/bath*

![nate swim bridge](/../_images/june_26_vt/40_nate_swim_bridge.jpg)
*confusing everyone else at the swimming hole with our mode of transport*

Anyway, it was a great ride. I'm glad we started it on a Thursday.

![meg cars](/../_images/june_26_vt/41_meg_cars.jpg)
*and... done!*

# Summary

Our longest bike tour ever was an awesome time. We experienced Vermont
in a way I've never experienced it before, carrying our food, water, trash,
and camping supplies on our bikes every step of the way. Not showering is
not that big a problem when you're always outside, and swim once or twice
a day. My dynamo setup provided us with light and power to recharge our
phones for navigation, and [ridewithgps](https://ridewithgps.com/?lang=en)
ensured that we could navigate with or without cell service.

![butterfly](/../_images/june_26_vt/42_butterfly.jpg)
*many butterflies*

I could absolutely live off of my bicycle for weeks at a time. So could Meg.
Maybe we will sometime. I'm gunning for a grand European bike tour next spring.
