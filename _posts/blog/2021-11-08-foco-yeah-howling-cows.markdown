Meg and I returned to day touring this weekend with a jam-packed exploration
of Fort Collins, Colorado: the land of bike lanes, howling cows, and horse
teeth. Why such a long gap since our last post? Well, over the last couple of months, we:

- attended a wedding
- drove 25 hours from Buffalo to Denver... without stopping to sleep
- explored the far east edge of Denver's Cherry Creek trail
- entertained guests at some of our favorite Denver breweries and parks.
  (thanks for visiting, Joe & Abby)!
- broke in a brand-new espresso grinder for the growing 2-person remote office

... plus a slew of bike rides to breweries, virtual game nights, and bicycle
slash coffee experiments. Also working, I guess.

Needless to say, the time was ripe for a personal weekend outside of the Denver
area. We've also been eying a move to a smaller town, since Denver is an
enormous megalopalis that we only lived in because Meg used to want to commute
to a physical office.

This weekend, we managed to kill two birds with one stone: we had a relaxing
time outside of Denver, and we just might have found where we'd like to live
next.

Before we jump into our most recent ride, a smattering of some recent
happenings in our lives:

# The Road to Fort Collins

The day began with a long, annoying drive up the Front Range. There's no
escaping it: I25 sucks. It's the major route up and down the population-booming
Front Range, and it's crazy busy at pretty much all times. The only thing that
makes I25 look good? I70, which winds through the mountains and grinds to
a complete halt every weekend all year round.

So because the highways in our state were built in the 1960s and haven't really
been improved or supplemented since, we migrated over to a not-highway, 287, as
soon as we could. It's far from my favorite road, but it gets the job done,
unlike I25. The journey on 287 took us through Loveland, a Boulder suburb I'd
heard of, but never visited before. It was exactly the kind of strip-mall filled
suburban hellscape I was afraid of -- all the fast food, big box stores, and car
lanes you can imagine. No room for people. So we got out of there pretty quick
too.

Soon enough, we arrived in Fort Collins. And to be honest, I was not initially
impressed. I mean, it's another small-but-sprawling Front Range city. It has
slightly more bike lanes painted on the roads. What's the big deal?

Meg and I hopped on our bikes and started down the
[Poudre River Trail](https://poudreheritage.org/locations/poudre-trail/), and soon caught a glimpse of
how special Fort Collins really is.

# A Pleasant Valley

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/poudre.webp" description="our journey started on the poudre river in fort collins" %}

The Poudre River Trail turned out to be just the kind of scenic greenway we've
come to love in Colorado: rocky rapids, cute bridges, isolation from noisy cars,
and in early November, the last bits of fall foliage making their way from
branches to the ground. But since we hopped on the trail close to the end, it
wasn't long before we graduated to a mixture of on-road and next-to-road paths.
An unusual design choice placed *both* directions of bicycle traffic on a single
side of the road... allowing us the unusual experience of riding *toward* oncoming traffic. Not a choice I would make, but hey -- at least traffic was
light. And it helps that the sky was utterly and completely blue, and a faint
November morning chill clung to the air, keeping it crisp and fresh.

As expected, after a couple of miles, the trail petered out entirely.
Fortunately, the end of the trail coincided with a popular nature preserve
and fishing spot encircled by a dirt road. Since the preserve stretched almost
all of the way to our destination, we decided to test out a potential shortcut,
and appreciate a nice park even if the shortcut didn't work out.

The park turned out to be far prettier than I'd hoped. Sapphire blue water, a
rugged red ridge rising up into the sky, and some washboardy-but-fun dirt roads
made for a fun ride around the lake. The only company we had was fishermen, and
the obligatory fisherman companion: lazy, medium-large dogs.

We reached the north end of the park, and I was slightly disappointed to
discover that our destination, Pleasant Valley Farms, maintained a rather tall and intimidating fence between their land and the park. We would have to take
the longer, car-trafficked way around. Oh well. We opted to finish our loop around the park, exploring the other half of the park across the lake from where we'd already ridden. But it wasn't long before we reached... another
impassible fence. And somehow we were on the "no trespassing" side of it.
Curious, when you haven't hopped any fences to get there.

The problem was easily solved with a bit of balance: the fence extended to
the edge of the lake, but no further, for obvious reasons. So we just passed the bikes around the fence, then jumped around ourselves. So much for padlocks
and barbed wire!

After the no-trespassing excitement, our ride mellowed out considerably. We
finished our ride around the park, hopped on the road, and whizzed over a
couple miles of rolling hills to reach our goal:
[The Howling Cow Cafe](https://howlingcowcafe.com/).

# The Howling Cow Cafe

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/howling_cow.webp" description="the howling cow cafe" %}

There's nothing like a well-run cafe to get your bike ride off to a good start.
The Howling Cow didn't disappoint, with well executed coffees, two particularly
fresh sandwiches, and, for some reason, one gloriously creamy milkshake. I
suppose you'd expect a dairy farm to make a great milkshake, but this one was
even better than I'd expected.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/cheeeeeeeeese.webp" description="they specialize in dairy. can you tell?" %}

We took in our sandwiches, coffee, and milkshake on the expansive lawn, and
enjoyed a day that was just breaking 70 degrees. Dozens of cyclists rode by
in the time it took for us to eat and drink, and a healthy chunk of those
cyclists swung by the Howling Cow for a bite to eat. Fortunately, they've got
an entire dedicated bicycle parking lot. It was nice to visit someplace within a 20 minute ride of a major city where nobody bothers to lock their bike --
another major difference from Denver, where even if you lock your bike in
your own garage, you're never really certain it'll be there when you come back
to it.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/cowling_mesa.webp" description="pleasant valley mesas" %}

After relaxing for a bit on the lawn and remarking on just how pleasant Pleasant
Valley Farms really was, we set out on the bikes again. This time, we didn't
really have a destination in mind.

# Horsetooth Reservoir

Our plan for the day mostly revolved around exploring the city: checking out
the bike paths, trying some beers, and investigating the local food truck
scene. But fate took over when we left the Howling Cow. We found ourselves
right behind another group of cyclists, and just before we arrived back at the Poudre River Trail, we noticed that the other cyclists deviated down a side
road. That road looked like it headed straight for the reservoir on the edge
of town, which has lots of trails and great views, so Meg and I decided to
check it out.

The ride started out with roads much like those we'd already ridden by Pleasant
Valley: rolling hills, wide shoulders, polite drivers. I'm sure those rolling
hills are beautiful the 30 days a year that they're actually green, mostly in May. But we soon hit our first big obstacle: a very tall, very steep, very long
hill right next to a dam for the reservoir.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/meg_and_the_hill.webp" description="little meg, big hill" %}

Fortunately, it comes with a
built-in rest stop: the road at the top of the dam, halfway up the hill (the
rest of the road continues up, up and away into the ridge between the reservoir and town). We gritted our teeth, and tackled the hill. By the time we made it
to the top of the dam, I was happy to shed a layer of jacket and sip some
water. But I didn't expect the view: a breathtaking vista of rocky ridge, reservoir, and just the faint outlines of high peaks peeking from behind
the foothills.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/dam.webp" description="dam" %}

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/that_dam_view.webp" description="it was nice on the dam" %}

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/gnarly_hill.webp" description="hill remains gnarly to look at halfway up" %}

And the views at the top of the ridge were even better, providing a view of the reservoir in addition to sweeping views of the entire Fort Collins area. Damn,
those guys have it nice. The ridge is literally right on the edge of town!

We continued down the ridgeline roadway for a few miles, taking in the views.
I was impressed at the road etiquette of (nearly) all drivers: pretty much everyone gave me a full lane's passing distance, instead of squeezing by within
inches. But after a few miles, I was content with the view, and ready to get off the road.

# Mandarb Gets in Touch with His Roots

As I've mentioned in previous posts, Meg rides a relatively new steel touring
bike, and I ride a 1990s steel mountain bike that's been (semi-professionally)
converted into a touring bike. In this episode, Meg and I try to take Mandarb
and Sully (those are the names of our bikes) on some mountain bike trails.

As we rode down the ridgeline roadway, I noticed that there were a fair number
of trails weaving their way through the park land on either side of the road.
By the time we were ready to leave the road, I'd spotted a perfect alternative:
a singletrack trail snaking its way down the mountain, with only a few dogs and
mountain bikes to dodge.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/mandarb_gets_back_to_singletrack.webp" description="in all fairness, mandarb's top tube literally says 'singletrack'" %}

Meg was (reasonably) skeptical at first, but eventually gave into the temptation
of adventure. The trail turned out to be chock full of rocks. And hairpin turns. And more rocks. And more dogs and bikes than I expected. Frankly, it
was a bit much with a [pannier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannier) full of
water, snacks, bicycle repair equipment, and layers mounted on Mandarb. But we
took it slow, let faster travelers pass us, and in the end we had an absolutely
brilliant time. Nothing quite like sailing down a mountain bike trail right
into the bike lanes of town.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/mountain_bike_trail.webp" description="not sure we'd have tackled this if we could see the whole thing from the start" %}

# Not Just Bikes

From the mountain bike adventure, Meg and I decided to tour a bit around town.
We really wanted to check out CSU and Fort Collins' supposed best-in-country
bike infrastructure. While Fort Collins isn't exactly Amsterdam, it's
a step above anything I've ever experienced in the US for bicycling. It's so
freeing and carefree to ride around town, because you don't have to *think*
about which roads are built to accommodate your bike. They pretty much all are.
Because there are so many bikes around, cars seem to have a natural (and
healthy) respect for cyclists, instead of zooming past you just to wait for
you when they have to turn in a block. On the CSU campus, the signage is
awesome: there's dedicated lanes for bikes, separate from the dedicated lanes
for pedestrians. Even better: in the densest parts of campus, there just
isn't a dedicated lane for cars at all. Take that, car-industrial complex.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/thats_not_a_car_lane.webp" description="there is no car lane in this picture" %}

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/ram.webp" description="i guess the csu mascot is the ram" %}

We were also impressed by the sheer number of bike racks and parked bikes
around town, especially on campus. It's clear that a huge proportion of
residents and college students use bikes to get around everywhere. In Denver,
Meg and I travel around on bikes all the time, because things are generally too
far to want to walk all the time. But finding an open and safe bike rack is
no easy feat. In Fort Collins, it feels like every business has multiple bike
racks. And they're all in use. I assume that any business that tries
to *not* have a bike rack would be run out of town.

# Beers and Bikes and Bros

After CSU, we headed over to the first brewery we could find that looked cute
-- not exactly a difficult task in Fort Collins. We ended up picking
[Stodgy Brewing](https://www.stodgybrewing.com/), whose employees are far from
the cantankerous misers the name implies. The beer selection was small but
competent. The outdoor space was sprawling and cute. The bike rack was...
many bike racks. The bathrooms were individual non-gendered toilet rooms
with shared sinks. The food truck was a simple but well-executed prosciutto and
artichoke heart flatbread. And it was super easy to get to Stodgy, because all
of the roads have bike lanes.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/stodgy_brewing.webp" description="even more racks" %}

# Mason Street

After our pit stop at Stodgy, it was time for some more exploration around
town. This time, Meg and I tried out the north-south bike-and-bus-only
thoroughfare up the center of town, the
[Mason Street Transitway](https://www.northerncoloradohistory.com/historic-mason-street/). As you'd expect, riding quickly north-south
through the heart of the city, hardly dealing with cars at all is a
very pleasant way to ride your bicycle. It goes to show that it is,
in fact, possible to create north-south bike routes through town. Looking
at you, [Denver](https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/transportation-infrastructure/programs-services/bicycles/bike-maps.html).

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/csu.webp" description="just a couple of old people riding around csu" %}

We eventually ended up right in the heart of Fort Collins: Old Town. A
super walkable stretch of restaurants, bars, shops, and a guest taproom
for every major Colorado brewery who isn't originally from Fort Collins.
Plus it has nice lights, pavers, and weird terminator statues. I don't
really care much for that kind of bumpin' downtown atmosphere, but it's
nice to know that it exists in a town for impressing visitors and
preventing your town from rotting into another
[Gary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary,_Indiana).

After exploring downtown, Meg and I headed over to
[Snowbank Brewing](http://www.snowbank.beer/), which has:

- good beer
- ample bike racks
- good outdoor space
- a cute logo
- rowdy birthday partiers, apparently

On our way over to Snowbank, we swung past two of the most famous
Colorado breweries, who both call Fort Collins home: Odell, and
New Belgium. New Belgium seemed to be hosting some kind of bicycle
race, and we had the pleasure of seeing one of the competitors ride
*two* bicycles at once down a bike lane to his truck. Only in Fort
Collins, I guess.

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/double_bike.webp" description="yep, that's a guy riding two bicycles at once" %}

# The Road Goes Ever On

After Snowbank, Meg and I headed back up the conveniently-close Poudre River
Trail back to Clem. The sun was just setting as we packed up the bikes, but
after such a fun day, it wasn't hard to motivate ourselves for the ride back
to Denver. Plus, we stopped at another local favorite brewery,
[4 Noses](https://www.4nosesbrewing.com/), in Broomfield, for another beverage
and a burrito bowl each. We took advantage of the empty Saturday night
suburban grocery stores to load up on supplies for the week, and headed home.

# Conclusion

{% include figure.html url="nov_08_foco/well_be_back.webp" description="we'll be back" %}

Fort Collins opened my eyes to just how good city bicycling can be.
I didn't bike back when I lived in Rochester because my bike was
stolen. I didn't bike back when I lived in New York City because
I didn't want to
[die](https://www.transalt.org/press-releases/vision-zero-in-crisis-2021-now-on-track-to-be-deadliest-year-in-de-blasio-era-new-york-city-nyc).
I started biking in Denver because the weather here is perfect for it, the
city is [flat as a pancake](https://www.city-data.com/forum/general-u-s/2976894-scenery-more-dramatic-looking-colorado-arizona.html), and places
I want to go are too far to walk. But I want to live someplace where I can
walk, bike, and (hopefully not too much!) drive around
[safely](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/08/09/denver-bike-thefts-concerns-bicycling-community-homeless-camps-denver-police/).
And now that Meg and I can both work fully remote, it might just be the
time to try.
