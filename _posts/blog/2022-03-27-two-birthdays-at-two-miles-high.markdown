Meg and I are moving to New Hampshire in just a couple of weeks.
We decided to say farewell (for now) to Colorado the best way we
could imagine:

- celebrating two birthdays in our favorite mountain town, Leadville
- two days of the best skiing Colorado can offer (that isn't totally
  insane for visiting friends from low altitudes)
- cross country skiing the only major trail around Leadville we haven't
  gotten around to yet
- a biking + food truck + brewery + park + bocce day around Denver
- one hell of a sunburn (Neutrogena, I will never forgive you)

Special thanks to our visiting friends Whitney and Eddy, who managed
to make it out for their *third* visit in two years of Colorado
living.

*Sidenote: why on earth do we say "an elegy" but "a eulogy"? Turns out,
[there's a perfectly logical explanation](https://www.quora.com/Which-of-the-indefinite-articles-a-or-an-precedes-the-word-eulogy).
English is silly.*

# Day 1: Arapahoe Basin

{% include figure.html url="mar_2022_leadville/01_abasin.jpg" description="windy morning at the basin" %}

As usual, we started our trip with a visit to A Basin, the coolest
mountain on the I70 corridor. The day started out windy as hell --
they didn't even have the Montezuma backside bowl open! --
but the frontside conditions were good enough to have a fun time
anyway. We spent the morning exploring all of the trails we usually
ignore on the frontside, zooming through trees and moguls and anything
else we could find.

After a quick pit stop for beers, Bloody Marys, and chicken fingers,
the wind started to ease up. It wasn't long before they opened the
Montezuma bowl up, and we tired ourselves out completely riding the
untouched bowls and glades until closing time. Nothing makes
you appreciate the backside of a mountain more than being limited to
the frontside all morning.

After our day of skiing, we headed over to Leadville to stay for the
night and prepare an elaborate meal of chicken and pasta.

Note: it turns out there was a [significant avalanche on Loveland pass](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/avalanche-us-6-loveland-pass/73-0c332d9a-2f9e-4422-8fa3-524f833d28bd)
right after we drove through to get to A Basin. That isn't surprising,
given the fact that it was warm, super windy, and they were actively
avalanche blasting at A Basin throughout our day of skiing. But it's
pretty crazy to think about how narrowly we missed getting blocked by --
or caught in! -- an avalanche.

# Day 2: Ski Cooper

{% include figure.html url="mar_2022_leadville/03_cabin_morning.jpg" description="frosty morning before coop" %}

After our warmup day at a world-renowned ski resort, we were ready
to shred the gnar at Ski Cooper, a cute, locally-owned family-friendly
ski hill.

As usual, conditions were absolutely amazing. One things Coloradans
don't seem to appreciate: all of the big resorts are too popular for
their own good. They have amazing trails, fast lifts, huge volumes of
powdery snow every year, and make a shitton of money. But the amount
of traffic at Ikon resorts (not even mentioning Epic resorts, which
are even busier) tends to scrape damn near all of that powder off of
the mountain within a day or two of each snowfall.

{% include figure.html url="mar_2022_leadville/04_coop.jpg" description="ski cooper is the best ski hill in CO - don't tell your friends" %}

I absolutely love every trail at Ski Cooper. The groomers are firm,
but soft enough to easily carve; the glades start out slick, but soften
up within an hour of open so you can easily set your preferred pace and
stop on a dime if you see an obstacle; and even the ungroomed trails
still have sections of untouched powder on pretty much any day of the
year.

The design of the hill is awesome, too: you've got a million ways down
from any point on the mountain, little glades pockmarked between all of
the trails, and somehow you never end up doing the exact same run. It's
the only ski place I've ever been where I feel like I can cruise anywhere
at all unless it's behind a fence. (OK, Keystone is kind of like that too...
but they have a million miles of fence along 90% of their runs, so it's
not quite the same).

Oh, and they have great chicken fingers, the best chili of any ski hill
I've ever been to, a simple, decent, and cheap beer selection... and
incredibly friendly employees.

I really hope they stay off the radar of vacation traffic in Colorado.
This place is the best exactly the way it is, and I hope it doesn't get
trampled to death like every other trail, mountain, and campsite within
3 hours of Denver.

Anyway, it was a great day of skiing. We zoomed through glades, moguls,
and groomers on a constant loop, barely even stopping for lunch. It
was beautiful out all day, and even got warm enough at the end of the day
that one group decided to ski down the hill without shirts. Whitney,
the only one in our group who didn't grow up regularly skiing or snowboarding,
built the confidence to try some glades, and mostly survived some black
diamond moguls and trees she definitely didn't accidentally wander onto.

It was a great day. When I come back to Colorado, Leadville and Ski Cooper
are at the top of my list. When you can avoid the crowds, the mountains
are a truly incredible place that's unlike anywhere else in the US.

# Day 3: Cross Country Skiing the Mineral Belt Trail

Once we tired ourselves out with two days of skiing, the obvious next
move was... another day of skiing. But this time on (relatively) flat
terrain.

{% include figure.html url="mar_2022_leadville/06_meg.jpg" description="enjoying the leadville views" %}

Meg and I have biked and walked the Mineral Belt Trail before, and even
cross country skied small sections in town at night. This was our first
time skiing the entire trail. At 11 miles, the Mineral Belt Trail is just
a smidge shorter than our previous trip skiing the 14 mile Turquoise Lake Loop.
But this trip really gave us an appreciation for what blue skies, warm
weather, and grooming can do for cross country skiing.

{% include figure.html url="mar_2022_leadville/09_you_high_bruh.jpg" description="rocky mountain high" %}

The Turquoise Lake Loop took us nearly 7 hours to complete, including a
brief stop for lunch. It was almost completely ungroomed, actively
snowing, and very hilly. The Mineral Belt Trail took us about 3 hours
total, including a long stop for lunch. It was completely groomed,
sunny enough to give us all a nasty sunburn through sunblock, and
only gradually hilly.

{% include figure.html url="mar_2022_leadville/12_cabin_apres.jpg" description="really earned the apres after our 11 mile jaunt" %}

It was a great time. We got some awesome views of Leadville, learned some
fun historical facts, drank some tasty beers, and ate some solid salami
sandwiches.

# Day 4: Interlude

{% include figure.html url="mar_2022_leadville/13_leadville.jpg" description="classic leadville lookin cute as always" %}

Not much to say about our trip back to Denver. The weather was great,
the fish burritos were as filling and delicious as ever, and the aloe
felt really great on our faces when we got back home. We played *way*
too much Settlers of Catan and probably drank a few too many beers.
And I learned all about Jello Cake, Whitney's birthday cake of choice
(only one day late -- who wants to bake a cake in a short-term rental?).
Happy belated birthday, Whitney!

# Day 5: Bikes, Beers, Bocce, and Ninja Ramen

{% include figure.html url="mar_2022_leadville/14_ninja_ramen.jpg" description="mmm ninja ramen" %}

Our last day, we followed the classic Meg & Nate Denver formula: we
hopped on our bikes, drank tasty beer and ate tasty food truck food
at one of our favorite breweries, then picked up some cans to drink
in the park while we played bocce. The parks in Denver were *packed*
on Sunday, no surprise given the weather in the high 70s. But we
carved out a nice spot for a game and had a wonderful time hanging
out in the park. Add in Meg's birthday ice cream cake when we got
home, and Sundays don't get much better.

# Eulogy for Denver

As I mentioned in the intro of this post, Meg and I won't be here
in Denver for long. We originally wanted to move to the mountains
of Colorado... but all it takes is a couple of soul-crushing months
looking for a reasonable rental to shut down that idea. In the end,
we decided to give New Hampshire a shot. It'll give us easy access to
friends, family, outdoor activities, world-class gravel biking,
Montreal, Boston, Burlington, Portland, New York... and offices for
our now-permanent remote work arrangements. We'll be moving to
Littleton in mid-April, so stay tuned for an update on our cross
country drive. I hope it'll be interesting, but not *too* interesting.
