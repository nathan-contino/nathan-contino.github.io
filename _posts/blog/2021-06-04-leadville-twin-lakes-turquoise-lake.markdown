This weekend's bike trip in Lake County was a little different from our
past bike trips. I learned:

- some valuable lessons about charging your bike lights

- that Mandarb (my 1990s steel mountain bike) can handle just about
  any terrain I can throw at him

- that a 13% grade is just about the steepest hill I can climb on
  rocky, muddy terrain

- even if Colorado is *usually* sunny... that thunderstorms can still take
  several hours to blow over

<!-- readmore -->

Even so, I had an absolute blast. It felt good to complete my most difficult
bike ride ever (with both natural and personal-stupidity imposed obstacles)
and come out safe and sound on the other side. After this weekend, I'm finally
starting to feel ready for camping with just the bicycles. And we've even
figured out a solid strategy for beating Denver's famous weekend mountain
traffic.

# The Legend of the Ghost Starbucks

It all started Friday morning, sometime around 6 AM. Meg and I got up, had a
quick smoothie and an aeropress, and headed up into the mountains. By 7:30, we reached our intended destination: a Starbucks at
[Copper Mountain](https://www.coppercolorado.com/). We picked it as a pleasant
looking option for working remotely all day, where we could keep our laptops
charged, sit at a patio space, subtly position beautiful mountain views behind
us during video chats with coworkers, and not feel too bad about taking up a
seat all day.

At least, that was the plan.

But it turns out that despite a very convincing
[Google Maps listing](https://goo.gl/maps/YFusdLqZa8SwnY8S6) for that Starbucks,
the location itself is now
[closed](https://www.starbucks.com/store-locator/store/1013454/copper-mtn-village-mountain-plaza-209-ten-mile-cr-suite-4-frisco-co-80443-us). Sometime in the last 4 weeks, based on the last review and images on the
listing, that Starbucks disappeared off the face of the planet. There wasn't
even a sign left behind!

Anyway, there went our plan to hang out all day at the closest Starbucks to
Leadville and work remotely so we could nab a campsite in the early afternoon.
Instead, we drove up to new record holder of "closest Starbucks to Leadville,"
currently found in [Frisco](https://www.townoffrisco.com/). My review as
follows:

- they didn't have any [bacon gouda](https://old.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/5rh58v/ode_to_bacon_gouda/) breakfast sandwiches left, 0/10 stars

- ample outdoor space (glass garage doors, at a chain coffee shop?)

- OK amount of outlets

- super friendly employees (no offense, University of Rochester campus
  Starbucks)

- great views of the mountains to intimidate my coworkers in video chats

All in all, it served us well for a morning's remote work.

In the afternoon, we spent our lunch hour travelling down to
[Leadville](https://leadville.com/) to nab some lunch and inch
closer to our intended campsite. We ended up eating at the
[Silver Llama](http://silverllamamarket.com/), a touristy yet competent cafe.
A burrito and some chicken later, we headed down to our final destination:
Twin Lakes.

# Double the Lakes, Double the Fun

Twin Lakes has no shortage of beautiful campsites, but seeing as we live
in Colorado and *everyone* constantly wants to hike and camp, we were a little
nervous that we'd show up and all the campsites would be occupied, or even
worse, that we'd end up at a campsite with no view of the lakes and mountains.

We were pleasantly surprised to find our preferred campground almost completely
deserted. I suppose mose Coloradans were tuckered out from a Memorial Day
weekend of maskless festivities. We parked, set up the tent at a beautiful overlook of the lakes, and attempted to work remotely. But the view was too
damn good, so we tossed the laptops in the car and took the bikes out for a
sunset spin.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/3_nate_karate.jpg" description="camp karate fashion" %}

I've said this before, but let me remind you: Meg and I don't ride mountain
bikes. Well, we don't ride *modern* mountain bikes, which come with dual
(and sometimes triple!) suspension, hydraulic disk brakes, knobbly tires,
and all kinds of fancy features that let you ride over rocks and bumps and
other nonsense without vibrating your bones into dust. My bike, Mandarb, is a
steel mountain bike from the 1990s with no suspension at all. Meg's bike, Sully,
is basically a modern equivalent with better brakes. They've got chonky tires,
but that's about it for mitigating bumps and rocks. Our bikes are awesome
for pavement, dirt roads, gravel, and even some light
[singletrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_track_%28mountain_biking%29).
But they aren't exactly optimal for challenging mountain bike terrain
like you'll find at ski resorts during the summer these days.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/1_nate_bike.jpg" description="this road should have been foreshadowing for saturday" %}

Of course, that didn't stop us from taking on 10% and higher grades on rocky,
sandy roads near our campsite at the base of
[Mount Elbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elbert), the tallest
mountain in Colorado. But it did teach us some technical skills that came
in handy for our long Saturday ride.

So we went on a nice (if steep) ride and were rewarded with sweeping views
of Independence Pass, Twin Lakes, and the Collegiate Peaks. The ride down
took almost as long, since we had to take those steep grades slowly, but
it was beautiful riding through the aspens at sunset, so who can really
complain. We got back to the campsite, whipped up some camp macaroni and
cheese on our stove, and called it a night early so we could get the maximum
amount of time on the bikes on Saturday.

# The Saturday Loop

6:30 AM: We got up, made a quick double batch of camp oatmeal and aeropress
coffee, and headed out on the first section of our ride: biking from Twin
Lakes to Turquoise Lake.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/6_forebay.jpg" description="they say montana is big sky country, but colorado has some pretty big skies" %}

We started out on a surprisingly smooth paved road that snaked its way through
even more campsites that I had possibly imagined existed by Twin Lakes. And then
we saw one of the weirdest... houses? That I've ever seen.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/7_weird_house.jpg" description="when you look at a place and think “weird” but also think “i’d live there”" %}

Soon the trail gave way to gravel as we passed a mine with views so nice,
it made me consider working at a mine.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/8_mines.jpg" description="still a mining town" %}

After a short time on gravel, we were back to the pavement and riding through
ranch land. But it wasn't long before we made our way to a dirt seasonal road
that really wasn't anything more than an ATV trail. (Sidenote: we'd later
learn just what an ATV trail can be in the mountains. More on that later)

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/9_seasonal_road.jpg" description="the true sign of a well chosen bike route" %}

This ended up being my favorite road of the entire trip: just enough roughage
of rocks and sand on the raod to keep things interesting, but generally smooth
sailing, peace and quiet, and absolutely crazy views of the
[Mosquito Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_Range) on the eastern
side of the valley. All we saw of humanity the entire time was one or two dirt bikes and perhaps one tent at a campsite.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/10_dirt_road.jpg" description="sandy in sections but overall a beautiful road" %}

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/11_green_trees.jpg" description="green trees and bliss" %}

But the lazy dirt roads can't last forever. The last section of our trek to
Turquoise Lake brought us back to paved ranch roads and past
[Mount Massive Golf Course](https://www.mtmassivegolf.com/),
allegedly the highest altitude golf course in the
US. A few more cars here, but not too many, and everyone passed us at a safe
distance and speed.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/13_mount_massive_golf.jpg" description="mount massive golf course is a cutie, next time we will bring the clubs" %}

A short climb after the golf course, we reached
[Sugar Loaf Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Loaf_Dam). Damn, it was
beautiful. (sorry)

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/15_point_to_camp.jpg" description="camp and clem are somewhere around there" %}

After a brief photoshoot and water break (hey, Colorado is hot and dry!), we
started on the loop on routes 9, 4 & 9C around the lake. This was actually
our second time around the loop -- we did the same trip on cross country skis
back in March! The summer views are just as good, and biking is at *least*
four times as fast as cross country skiing, but there was something special
about the pure peace and quiet of snowbound Turqoise lake in winter. At least
until the snowmobiles show up.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/18_nate_skis.jpg" description="hard to believe nate is skiing a similar incline" %}

We rode up and down quite a few hills at Turquoise Lake, and at the very
summit of the last uphill segment, we took the opportunity for lunch at
[Shimmering Point Overlook](https://www.gjhikes.com/2020/11/shimmering-point.html). This was actually the exact same spot where we
lunched when we cross country skiied, though we had a better view this
time since we weren't able to deviate much from the groomed trail in
March.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/19_lunch.jpg" description="just two sandal wearing adventure bikers drinking hard kombucha and eating salami sammies" %}

Some hard kombucha, salami sandwiches, and cheddar
bunnies (the store was out of [pink goldfish](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/best-goldfish-flavors-ranked), in my defense) later, we were on
our way downhill, zooming through the last quarter of the lake loop at
record speed. We checked out the other overlook points, but they were
honestly just lower altitude versions of Shimmering Point with slightly
worse views and some moderately fun gravel paths to bike on.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/20_meg_in_trees.jpg" description="channeling some cycling about vibes" %}

The downhill ride from our lunch spot brought us almost all the way to
Leadville, where I found a nice gravel path along the side of the road
and we checked out the very unusually organized
[Evergreen Cemetery](https://leadville.com/the-evergreen-cemetery-a-record-of-leadvilles-past/), which is very...
gridded.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/23_cemetery.jpg" description="cemetery exploration never lets us down" %}

After that quick stop, we headed over to the best brewery in
Leadville, [Two Mile Brewing Company](http://twomilebrewing.com/). It's
also the *only* brewery in Leadville (RIP [Periodic Brewing](http://www.periodicbrewing.com/)). That's where we enjoyed a late lunch
or maybe early dinner, depending on how you define eating at 3:30. A
couple of beers, some sandwiches, and some [potachos](https://www.todaysparent.com/recipe/appetizers/potatchos-recipe/) later,
we engaged in a modest amount of touristing and stopped by
[Melanzana](https://melanzana.com/) to nab some only-available-in-leadville
hoodies.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/24_leadville.jpeg" description="cute leadville pics taken by nate while meg is in melanzana" %}

After that, we were ready for the final segment of the ride, which
I have affectionately dubbed...

# The Meat Grinder

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/26_nate_bridge.jpg" description="pros of meg being slow are getting sweet pics like this" %}

In my last post, I started to make up random names for rides. If I had to
make up a name for our travels in the foothills east of Leadville, this
would be it. It had it all: large rocks, great views, steep grades, rain,
steeper grades, mud, steepest grades, and even some fun historical fact
learning.

We began with a ride up out of town toward the
[Matchless Mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchless_Mine), where rich
people decided to leave around a ton of old mining equipment when a mine
stopped being profitable.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/25_mines_and_leadville.jpg" description="not a bad view to have when working a life threatening job at the mines" %}

From the mine, we hopped on Leadville's
[Mineral Belt Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_Belt_National_Recreation_Trail), which was just as pleasant for
bike riding in the summer as it was for walking and skiing in the winter.
Very nicely paved, with great views, and almost too many plaques and
historical facts. After the trail, we switched over to mountain roads
in the foothills. That's where things got interesting.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/28_wildflowers.jpg" description="more flowers for our girl flowersbywhit" %}

The mountain roads of **The Meat Grinder** started off nice enough:
next to no cars (perhaps two the whole paved segment), nice sealed
pavement, decent grades. Then it started raining.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/27_meg_nate_rain.jpg" description="was actually pretty fun to do some rain riding" %}

Then our path took
us on a dirt road. Then that road was very steep. And very rocky.
And wasn't really a road, but seemed to be an ATV trail dubbed the
"Silverback Trail" that even a beefy, lifted 4x4 AWD vehicle would
struggle with. But alas, we continued, preferring the quiet, technical
roads to slogging down the shoulder of a 65 MPH highway.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/29_nate.jpg" description="oh to think we thought we still had time for pictures" %}

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/30_muddy_gravel.jpg" description="this isn't even a 7% grade" %}

Then it was 7:30, and we realized we were still up in the mountain
foothills, 15 miles or so from our campsite, with sunset looming at 9 PM.
No problem -- we got out our bike lights for visibility, and picked up the
pace a little, remaining cautious on the rocky downhills.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/31_river_trees.jpg" description="what a beaut" %}

We reached a main-ish paved road around 8:45 and hit our next obstacle:
a closed paddock gate. Even though we *definitely* didn't pass through any
gates on our way there.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/32_dirt_mountains.jpg" description="you know the view is good when you are racing the darkness of the night but stop for the pic anyways" %}

But fortunately the gate wasn't locked: it was just chained up. So we didn't
have to do any fence or gate hopping. We made it onto the paved road without
issue, carefully closing the gate for the next confused bicyclist.

But then Meg's front bike light died. No big deal -- I could just light
the way for both of us with my front light, and it wasn't even dark yet.

We headed down the road past some cute cows as the sun finally hit
[Mount Massive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Massive) in the distance.
And that's when we hit our next snag. We were supposed to take the next left
to ride down an empty dirt country road, which would let us cross the 65 MPH
highway instead of having to ride down it at all. But we somehow missed that
turn. Some frantic map-consulting later, we decided to double back past the
cute cows to try to find the dirt road to avoid riding on the highway shoulder.

That's when we found that the "country dirt road" was blocked by a rancher who decided that the through-road through his ranch was actually his private
driveway. If the fence and the gate wasn't enough, the triple padlock setup
convinced us to find another route. We sucked it up, turned around, and passed
the cute cows for the third time. And we found ourselves, as darkness fell,
riding 1.2 miles down the shoulder of a wet 65 MPH highway. I don't think I've
ever ridden faster.

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/road_10.png" description="this guy" %}

We made it down the highway with no real issues, and started back down the
desolate paved ranch roads and the gravel mining road. That's when "dark"
turned to "pitch black" and I realized that the moon was nowhere to be
seen and cloud cover stopped any starlight from reaching the ground.
Fortunately my bike light was fully charged and my panniers are very, very
obnoxiously reflective.

By the time we made it back, it was truly dark night, our bikes were totally
covered in mud, and all I wanted was to curl up in my sleeping bag. Of course,
we still had to set up the tent (it gets windy in Colorado, so I wasn't going
to leave it out all day), wash the mud off of ourselves, lock up the bikes, and
make dinner. But after 60 miles and 6,000 vertical feet, that just didn't
seem like much work in comparison.

# Conclusion

{% include figure.html url="june_04_bike_trip/21_nate_and_meg.jpg" description="sony alpha self timer for the win" %}

Bike touring continues to be my absolute favorite way to explore towns and
regions in Colorado. The ample dirt roads, beautiful views, bike paths, and
feeling of exploration on the bike all combine to give a sense of accomplishment
that's very different (and if you ask me, far superior) to hiking or driving
around. You really get to know the lay of the land, and you can just take your
time exploring an area. Just remember to charge your lights before each ride.

For our next adventure, Meg and I plan to finally load up the tent, sleeping
bags, and other camping equipment on the bikes so we'll have everything we
need right there on our ride. That way, we won't have to ride to any specific destination in the dark -- we can just camp whereever we want. No more forced
nighttime highway rides!
