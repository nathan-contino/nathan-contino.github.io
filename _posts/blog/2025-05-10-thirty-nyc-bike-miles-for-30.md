This weekend, we biked about 30 miles around Brooklyn, Queens, and (technically) Manhattan in honor of my 30th birthday.

We began with a ride around Governor's Island:

Stopped for a cheeky pint at Three's Brewing on the island:

Once we realized the ferry ride (though beautiful) to our next destination, Roosevelt Island, would take _longer_ than just biking up there up the [Great Hipster Silk Route](https://bikesnobnyc.blogspot.com/2008/10/no-getting-around-it-cycling-and.html), we ditched the ferry, preferring the less-scenic, smellier, but more engaging route. Of course I didn't take any pictures of that route, but here's a picture of Roosevelt Island:

From there, we gave up on the "islands" theme of the day, since Randall's Island is a huge pain to reach from Astoria over the Triborough Bridge ([for now](https://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-celebrates-new-bike-and-pedestrian-paths-robert-f-kennedy-henry-hudson-and-cross)). So instead we headed up the coast, visited Astoria Park (where you can at least look out at those islands), and then made our way inland to Singlecut OG:

After a pint and an afternoon meal, we made our way south through Astoria to Sunnyside, where we took a quick pit stop at Alewife Brewing:

Before long, we resumed our route on the [Kosciuszko Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosciuszko_Bridge), which does indeed fulfill the promise of 'nicest bicycle lane in NYC':

Though I'm not sure I love the symbolism:

Eventually, we routed our way back through Brooklyn to a tasty burrito, which we brought home to enjoy. We forgot to put candles in it because we were really hungry, but you can use your imagination:

Of course, now that I'm older, I'm wise enough never to do that again.
