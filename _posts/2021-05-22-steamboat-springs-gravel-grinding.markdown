Last weekend, Meg and I embarked on our first majority non-pavement
bicycle trip. No, we didn't take the bikes on water -- we decided to
give the [rural dirt and gravel roads in Steamboat Springs](https://www.steamboatchamber.com/activities/biking/gravel-biking/)
a try.

I've been riding a modernized steel 90s mountain bike ever since Meg
and I moved to Colorado last year. Ever since we found a sick deal on
a [Surly Disc Trucker](https://www.cyclingabout.com/surly-long-haul-trucker-the-best-all-round-touring-bike/)
for Meg, we've both been itching for a chance to take the bikes out
on some dirt and gravel. You might know that Steamboat Springs is world-renowned for mountain biking and skiing, but it also happens
to have one of the greatest gravel biking communities in the world.
This was our chance to see what that's all about.

# Travel to Steamboat

We headed out to Steamboat after work on Friday. Fortunately, we're
getting close to the Summer solstice, so the days are awfully long
right now, giving us a lot of daylight for our journey.

Unfortunately, it's the off season at Steamboat right now between
prime ski season and prime mountain bike season. Which means that
most of the restaurants in town close down at 9 PM or so, which
actually means that most kitchens stop serving food at around
8 PM.

![steamboat hotel]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/steamboat_hotel.jpg){:width="100%"}
*65.00 is a god damn steal*

Sadly, it's also snowmelt season at Steamboat right now,
which means that the [Yampa River](https://www.americanrivers.org/river/yampa-river/),
which flows right next to the bike path from our hotel to town,
is super high right now. Which means that some sections of the
bike path are currently underwater. Which means detours.

So we showed up at Steamboat around 7:30, and tried to take the
bike path to town (we just drove 3 hours!), but we were really
hungry, so the detours were really confusing, and daylight
started to dwindle, which made us realize that all of the
restaurants were about to close. Note to Steamboat DOT: orange
paper is not very visible towards dusk, so you should really
mark your bike detours with something reflective.

We ended up driving up to town in the car. Then we:

1. Wolfed down a tasty burrito at [Taco Cabo](http://www.tacocabo.com/).
   Bonus points for pressing your burritos, Taco Cabo.

2. Got a beer and a salad at [Mountain Tap Brewery](https://www.mountaintapbrewery.com/),
   a key lime lager and a coconut brown ale.

3. Split a to-go crowler of Mountain Tap's haziest brew back at the
   (outdoor!) (heated!) (not populated!) pool at the hotel. Nothing
   like a nice swim under the stars at the end of a long day.

4. Hit the hay so we'd be ready for an early morning of gravel biking
   on the...

# Sleeping Giant Loop

![steamboat map]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/steamboat_map.png){:width="100%"}
*an artist's impression of steamboat springs, colorado*

The town of Steamboat Springs sits in the middle of a big ol' valley.
The [Yampa Valley](https://www.yampavalleybank.com/), to be specific,
if the local bank conglomerate is to be believed. The two largest
geological formations in the valley happen to be the two things we
looped on this trip. The first of those formations is
[Elk Mountain](https://www.summitpost.org/the-sleeping-giant-elk-mountain/592284),
which some folks apparently nicknamed "Elk Mountain". Don't even
bother looking that up to see if I'm lying -- it turns out that
almost every state in the country contains an "Elk Mountain",
because I guess the answer to the question "what do we call this
mountain?" tends to be "Uh, I guess elk live there, so maybe
'Elk Mountain'?". Not like "Sleeping Giant"
[is](https://sleepinggiantbrewing.com/)
[that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Giant_%28Ontario%29)
[original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Giant_%28band%29)
[either](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribarth).

![elk mountain]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/elk_mountain.jpg){:width="100%"}
*elk mountain in all it's glory*

Anyway, on Saturday we looped around Elk Mountain on a bunch of
dirt and gravel roads. We got up around 7 AM and immediately biked
our way over to breakfast at the
[Seedz Cafe](https://www.seedz-cafe.com/menu),
which served up a surprisingly healthy (but still tasty) veggie
chorizo breakfast burrito and a plate of eggs benedict covered in a
phenomenal white pepper gravy.  My only regret is not ordering my
burrito smothered in green chili -- my favorite local burrito place
in Denver contains plenty of green chili already, so the thought
didn't even occur to me.

![meg brekky]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/meg_brekky.jpg){:width="100%"}
*okay, maybe meg's breakfast wasn't exactly healthy*

Once we were fueled for the day, it was time to hop on our actual
bike route. We began the trip with the most unpleasant section:
a 2 mile connecting stint on a medium-high traffic highway with
cars blowing by at 45+ miles per hour. Yuck. Fortunately, that
didn't last long, and we were quickly dumped out on a side road
with poorly maintained pavement and the promise of cows in the
distance.

![dirt road biking]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/dirt_road_biking.jpg){:width="100%"}
*the first uphill climb of the day*

Soon after getting off the main road, we summited a (at the time)
pretty huge hill. Our past rides have never really gone above
8% grade or so, so this was our first chance to drop down into the
very lowest "granny gear" of Mandarb and Sully to crank out the
hill at a slow but steady speed. We passed with flying colors,
and moved on ready to crush whatever hills challenged us next.

After a couple more miles, the poorly maintained pavement dissolved
into dirt at a suspiciously photogenic "pavement ends" sign. Meg
and I finally got our first taste of biking on a totally dirt road,
though personally I'd say that the constant roadwork, resurfacing,
and potholes in Denver have already treated us to plenty of that.

![pavement ends]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/pavement_ends.jpg){:width="100%"}
*time to grrrrnnd some grrrvvvlllll*

Once we hit the dirt roads, we barely worried about cars any more.
You can only drive so fast on a dirt road, and the small scattered
rocks kicked up by any vehicle create enough noise that we were
warned well in advance of the one or two vehicles that passed us the
entire ride.

The dirt roads also signaled the start of the cute, isolated rural
homes of the Steamboat region. The first section of our ride was
full of developments, vacation homes, and mansions. But once the
pavement disappears, all you see is ranches and beautiful country
homes.

![cute house]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/cute_house.jpg){:width="100%"}
*one of the many very cute houses north of steamboat*

Meg and I sometimes ride side by side on empty bike
paths, but there's usually enough traffic (and so little path width)
that we typically end up single file for most of the ride. Riding
on dirt was a huge step up in conversation for us since we were
able to ride side-by-side on very wide roads (for a bicycle) without
worrying about other vehicles on the road.

![meg bushes]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/meg_bushes.jpg){:width="100%"}
*finding pee spots in ranch land was not easy*

Around 9:40, we spotted our first non-domesticated large animal (NDLA) of
the ride, a creature that I suspect was either a very large deer or
a female elk. Given that we were riding around Elk Mountain, I like
to think that it was *the* elk for which the mountain is named. Cute
fella.

After that, it was hard to look in any direction without spotting
a prairie dog nestled among the wildflowers. Seriously, there were
so many of them. We also spotted a group of what might have been
actual deer (or baby elk?) on a nearby ridge.

*potentially more elk friends?*

We tried to get some action shots of both Meg and myself riding
up a particularly pretty hill, but unfortunately I'm a little bit
too speedy on my bike -- Meg didn't tell me that she hadn't
taken the picture yet, so I ended up catching up with her before
she could record anything. So instead I rounded the next corner
and Meg got some *fake* action shots of me riding the wrong
direction.

Just after our action shot shenanigans, we started to spot wooly
caterpillars crossing the road. Naturally, we had to make sure
that our caterpillar friend made it across the road safely. And
if that meant taking hundreds of close-up photos of the
caterpillar... well, nobody's perfect. And I suspect that he
enjoyed the photoshoot.

At 11, we enjoyed lunch at a beautiful spot at the top of a
pretty large hill at almost the exact middle our our route.
At this point, we finally started to see cyclocross and gravel
bikers coming in the opposite direction up the hill, clad in
lycra and spandex galore. We cheersed them with our 16oz cans
of hard kombucha and appreciated the fact that we packed
a picnic of salami sandwiches and brownies instead of trying
to make the maximum possible mile time.

Around 12:15, we reached a very tiny old cemetery with a
breaktaking view. If you're looking to bury anybody, this is
a pretty solid location -- you can just take in the mountains
while you mourn! Cemeteries ought to be beautiful, and this
is among the best I've seen.

*nate jotting down the coordinates of the best place to bury a body*

The rest of our trek routed us through even rougher dirt roads,
several steeper climbs, and -- of course -- a whole lot more
cows. It was awfully satisfying to benchmark our progress by
our view of Elk Mountain, which was visible throughout the
entire ride, but from a slowly evolving angle.

The very last half hour of our ride was slightly spoiled by
some significant headwinds near the airport north of town.
Fortunately this section was largely downhill, which sort
of cancels out the headwind... with the exception of the
noise, which was maddening after just a few minutes. We
soldiered our way through and made it to our first planned
stop of the route:
[Butcherknife Brewery](https://www.butcherknifebrewing.com/).

![meg downhill]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/meg_downhill.jpg){:width="100%"}
*a happy meg cruisin'*

Sadly, Butcherknife was closed the day of our Sleeping
Giant ride, seemingly for the entire month of May. Because
I guess the off season is literally the most beautiful
season to visit, with the best temperatures, the most
wildflowers, and the most greenery. We rode another mile
down the road and gave our valuable tourist dollars to
their competitor, [Storm Peak](https://stormpeakbrewing.com/),
instead. Shoutout to
[Moe's Original BBQ](https://www.moesoriginalbbq.com/lo/steamboat)
for putting damn near the maximum amount of pulled pork
possible on their sandwiches -- at the end of the ride,
we'd very much earned it.

![beer]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/beer.jpg){:width="100%"}
*a post-bike pils is always a good choice -meg*

The brewery was right at the north end of town, so we
grabbed a six pack of beer and took a nice ride down the
town bike path back to our hotel to enjoy some midday
brews and another swim.

For dinner, we originally planned to check out a fancy
looking cocktail bar with a solid looking list of pricy
appetizers. But by the time we got there, it was clear
that you needed a reservation to actually get a table.
So instead we ended up eating some grilled cheese bites
and much cheaper cocktails at
[the local distillery](https://www.steamboatwhiskeyco.com/).
The bartender hooked us up with some tasters of their
whiskey as well, convincing me to check them out the
next time I run low on rye.

After the distillery, we had another salad to restore
some semblance of healthy food after gorging ourselves
on grilled cheese bites. I'm not so sure that it was
that healthy an option since we also had three beers,
but hey, we were at a significant caloric deficit for
the day anyway after biking 60+ miles.

We topped off the day with -- you guessed it -- another
beer in the pool under the stars.

# Green Giant Loop

![road wet]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/road_wet.jpg){:width="100%"}
*luckily it was not wet*

Our second day, Meg and I decided to map out a custom
20-30 mile route to take it a little easier, since we
had a 3 hour drive back to Denver after the ride. We
settled on a route that looped around Emerald Mountain,
just west of town. Since people in Steamboat just make
up nicknames for mountains, I decided on the nickname
"Green Giant" for Emerald Mountain, since it's... green.
And large.

We started off the day with some suspiciously good
bagels for 7,000 feet. Kudos to
[Colorado Bagel Company](https://www.coloradobagel.com/)
for making one of the better everything bagel's I've
had since leaving NYC.

By 8, we were well on our way around the Green Giant loop
and enjoying the sunrise above Steamboat ski resort. As
it turns out, the local biking community has dispersed a
fleet of [portable toilets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_toilet)
on popular routes around town, presumably for photos like
you're about to see.

![portable toilet]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/portable_toilet.jpg){:width="100%"}
*meg peeing again*

After the portable toilet, we were having a blast.
Unfortunately, the locals had other plans. Our original
route used [Elk Lane](https://goo.gl/maps/1974zhjmCQVBnKpD6)
to cut down on hills and let us enjoy some forest scenery
on our route. But when we got to Elk Lane, the road was
marked with a not-so-friendly sign that Elk Lane is
PRIVATE and that GPS USERS should BE AWARE that it is
NOT a THRU ROAD. So we decided not to deal with the
annoying residents (who were lying, by the way, unless
satellite view of the road is wrong somehow) and turned
our morning into the Extended Green Giant Loop instead.
We could use the extra exercise anyway.

![mailboxes]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/mailboxes.jpg){:width="100%"}
*it's so private, even the USPS isn't allowed*

A few miles of sweeping pavement roads later, we reached
the end of the pavement and our first big hill. But first,
we spotted a cute red schoolhouse that it turns out is
actually a private residence that you definitely should
not take silly photos next to and whose residents you
should totally respect the privacy of. Totally.

![schoolhouse]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/schoolhouse.jpg){:width="100%"}
*we won't post the pics of us trespassing*

The first hill on this route was a slog, but the second
route was the steepest I've ever climbed on a bike. Still,
the beautiful views, perfect temperatures, lack of
traffic, and low-resistance "granny gear" all worked
together to keep us moving all the way to the top without
walking the bikes at all. And the views at the top of Elk
Mountain in the distance made it all worthwhile.

![meg uphill]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/meg_uphill.jpg){:width="100%"}
*its the climb -miley cyrus*

*climbs that lead to mountain views are always worth*

![nate and mandarb]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/nate_and_mandarb.jpg){:width="100%"}
*single pannier life making sure we wouldn't be stranded if we got a flat*

After a well-earned hill descent, we ended up on another
seasonal road through Emerald Mountain park along Cow
Creek. Disclaimer: Cow Creek does not have *nearly* enough
cows to justify the name. Shame on Routt County. This
section of the route was my personal favorite, though,
because for the first time all weekend we actually got
to ride through trees! We also got to tackle our first
dose of vaguely technical terrain on some rocky sections
of the road, where we learned that our bikes are even
more capable than we thought. Not planning on taking on
any singletrack any time soon, but in a pinch...

![trees]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/trees.jpg){:width="100%"}
*into the trees!*

![how now brown cows]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_26_bike_trip/how_now_brown_cows.jpg){:width="100%"}
*cow staring contest*

Anyway, once we departed Cow Creek, the ride finished
very quickly. Almost the entire rest of the route was
gently sloping downhill paved roads that required next
to no effort. After the hills we conquered earlier, it
was a nice break to just sit back and enjoy the valley
views.

When we got back to Steamboat Springs, our first stop
was -- as you'd expect -- food. This time, we decided
to stop by [Yampa Valley Kitchen](https://www.yampavalleykitchen.com/),
where I enjoyed the [Rösti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6sti)
(which is totally as good as it sounds, paired with a
fried egg) and Meg tried the chicken sandwich. We also
tried out their Cinnamon Toast Crunch latte and a few
other coffee drinks, which I'm pleased to report were
all fantastically made. And of course Meg had to try
out their soft serve ice cream with rainbow sprinkles,
because Meg lives for soft serve ice cream.

After that, we headed back to Denver, taking the long
way to avoid traffic on I-70 and enjoy the crazy views
of the continental divide from [Berthoud Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berthoud_Pass).

# Conclusion

As of this trip, we've decided that biking is our new favorite
way to experience new places in Colorado (and probably damn near
everywhere else, too). But just to clarify:

- we're not road bikers (who wants to wear that much lycra and spandex?)

- we're not gravel bikers (again, who wants to wear that much lycra
  and spandex?)

- we're not mountain bikers (neither of our bikes have suspension, and fast
  downhill is awfully scary on a bike if you ask me)

- we *might* be tourers of some light variety (I do use panniers)

- we *might* be bikepackers of some variety (Meg doesn't use panniers)

- we're probably [xbikers](https://old.reddit.com/r/xbiking/),
  which seems to roughly mean "adventure on a bike"

Just remember: we don't go fast, we don't do hard terrain, and we
spend a lot of time eating food and drinking beer. Doesn't sound
so bad now, does it?
