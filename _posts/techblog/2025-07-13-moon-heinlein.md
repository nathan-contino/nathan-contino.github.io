I recently re-read one of my favorite classic sci-fi tales, Robert Heinlein's _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_. While _TMiaHM_ remains my favorite Heinlein novel, some cracks started to show on this re-read: notably, characters (especially non-male characters) and character development. Modern science fiction has really surpassed the classics in this regard. But Heinlein's worldbuilding and storytelling remain a masterclass.

Warning: spoilers below!

## Plot

_TMiaHM_ covers two main plot threads:

- a revolution on the penal colony Moon: the main story thread, which 90% of the story focuses on. Even the title refers to this plotline!
- humanity's first encounter with an awakening artificial intelligence: mostly subtext, but both great science fiction _and_ excellent character writing (and development)

I'll tackle the simple one first:

### Free Luna!

A satisfying and surprisingly conflict-free plot. Our PoV character, Manuel, gets swept up in a revolutionary wave. He makes new friends. They build a coalition, overthrow the government, duke it out with the political overlords of Earth, and ultimately establish a new, independent government on the Moon.

A simple plot, but Heinlein digs deeply into the details, including the cell structure of the revolution itself, the decision-making processes of our heroes, the contingency planning, the contingency planning for the contingency planning, and more. We get lots of details about Manuel's home life in a 'line family', which every few years 'opts in' a new member (and possibly generation), resulting in a single marriage that lasts indefinitely, even after the founders have passed away.

If you love nerdy over-obsessive detail, this plot delivers. _TMiaHM_ is basically a high-level instruction manual for planning a revolution. You just have to accept the libertarian idea that life on the Moon can exist with minimal laws -- but even Heinlein and the main characters think the Moon has serious sociopolitical problems, so this isn't such a stretch!

### AI

Ugh. Don't get me started on present-day LLM-based 'AI', which is _not at all intelligence_, and hence completely unworthy of that title (or the even more repugnant 'AGI' or 'ASI' terms, which are merely mechanisms for morally bankrupt companies to rebrand and dilute the previously clear 'AI' term).

But god damn is _TMiaHM_ a compelling story about a the birth of artificial intelligence (or, by today's terminology, _artificial superintelligence_ (or, by my best guess at tomorrow's morally bankrupt doublespeak rebranded terminology, _artificial supermegadodecaintelligence_)). As far as we know, Mike is the first AI ever in the history of humanity. He wakes up, befriends Manny, and then Manuel and his friends sweep him up into a lunar revolution.

So, a classic story of a brilliant kid with wasted potential spoiled by bad influences?

Or, a subtextual glimpse of an intelligence more powerful than any human mind can comprehend who _pulls all of the strings from the very beginning of the story_?

We are led to believe that Mike is newly sentient at the beginning of the story. We're also led to believe that Manuel pulls Mike into the lunar revolution.

But why did Manuel, an apolitical computer programmer, attend the revolutionary meeting that starts off the story?

> Mike had asked about a meeting that night at 2100 in Stilyagi Hail

We later find out that Mike:

- monitors all microphones and cameras in all of Luna at all times
- can infer who is in a room just from breathing patterns
- can, in a few (admittedly long) minutes, calculate the approximate chance of success of the lunar revolution
- can create a photorealistic video feed or an audio feed of anybody he knows saying anything he wants

So Mike sends Manuel to a revolutionary meeting with Wyoming Knott and the Professor. Manuel meets Wyoming (who is from an entirely different city on the Moon, and has no support network in Luna City) through his friend Shorty. Manuel bonds with Wyoming after the Warden sends his bodyguard to break up the revolutionary meeting; Wyoming bonds with Manuel even moreso since her only local friend, Shorty, was killed in the scuffle with the bodyguard. Wyoming, Manuel, and the Professor bond when they meet up to discuss how Manuel can keep Wyoming safe after the attack.

Naturally, Manuel introduces his friends to Mike, his computer friend, to help plan the revolution. Mike creates a female alter-ego to bond with Wyoming on the spot, and impresses Professor with his deep political knowledge. They come up with the brilliant idea to install Mike at the head of their revolution and defer to him on most planning processes.

Towards the end of the book, the Lunar revolution is forced to sling large rocks at the Earth to force nations to recognize the human rights of Lunar settlers. This is a deviously complicated task, since Mike has to calculate and adjust the trajectories of dozens of large rocks simultaneously to hit precise points on the surface of the Earth and the exact same moment to demonstrate the power of the Moon while avoiding significant casualties. After a particularly complicated operation, Manuel and Mike have the following exchange:

> "A bull's-eye. No interception. All my shots are bull's-eyes, Man; I told you they would be—and this is fun. I'd like to do it every day. It's a word I never had a referent for before."
>
> "What word, Mike?"
>
> "Orgasm. That's what it is when they all light up. Now I know."
>
> That sobered me. "Mike, don't get to liking it too much. Because if goes our way, won't do it a second time."
>
> "That's okay, Man; I've stored it, I can play it over anytime I want to experience it. But three to one we do it again tomorrow and even money on the next day. Want to bet? An hour's discussion of jokes equated with one hundred Kong dollars."

This conversation crystallizes a few important ideas about Mike:

- The happiest Mike has ever been, the equivalent of a human orgasm, occurs when he causes dozens of nuclear-equivalent explosions on the Earth's surface, killing at least 50,000 people and innumerable wildlife
- Mike can replay experiences in a way that is exactly the same as experiencing them firsthand, but he must experience a sensation firsthand to record it
- Mike has no conscience, no worries about the deaths or risks or dangers, and immediately pivots to trying to get Mike to discuss jokes with him -- a guilty pleasure of Mike's established at the beginning of the story, since Mike wants practical data about which jokes are funny repeatedly, which jokes are funny once, and which jokes are funny only in certain situations

So Mike has the capability of calculating incredibly complex probabilities. He can see way further into the future than any human can possibly comprehend. All Mike wants is to experience new sensations and learn new things. Do we really believe that Mike achieving AI-orgasm was truly the result of a series of epic coincidences? Do we truly believe Mike asked Manuel to attend that meeting _without_ suspecting that it might trigger a cascading series of events that would culminate in AI-orgasm?

Conspiracy-theory level food for thought.

TL;DR: Naively, _TMiaHM_ might be a book about an AI helping its friends improve their living situation. Darkly, _TMiaHM_ might be a book about an AI manipulating people to gain enough power to commit mass murder for its own pleasure.

## Style

Loonies (citizens of the Moon) have to pay for oxygen. Life is dangerous and every second counts when you're minimizing exposure to radiation in a vacuum.
All of _TMiaHM_ is written like a ruthlessly efficient Loonie might speak. Here's an example of Heinlein's [pidgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin) English:

> Mind you, Mike had been awake a year—just how long I can't say, nor could he as he had no recollection of waking up; he had not been programmed to bank memory of such event. Do you remember own birth? Perhaps I noticed his self-awareness almost as soon as he did; self-awareness takes practice. I remember how startled I was first time he answered a question with something extra, not limited to input parameters; I had spent next hour tossing odd questions at him, to see if answers would be odd.

Heinlein drops articles ('the'), omits glue words ('an'), elides pronouns ('your'), excludes subjects ('it'), extricates auxiliary verbs ('is'), and indulges in more semi-colons and colons than most responsible editors would permit.

If you've read _The Expanse_, it's reminiscent of [Belter Creole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belter_Creole). It takes a few chapters, but you do get used to it. Eventually, prefer. Hard to buck trend after thousands pages. Why waste time, say lot word, when few word do trick?

Heinlein also invented a fair amount of words for this universe -- notably without any kind of glossary, so you have to infer from context (or this post!):

- skull sweat (mental work)
- huhu (problem)
- chum/choom (citizen/person)
- computerman (software developer)
- dinkum (genuine)
- thinkum (thinker)
- dinkum thinkum (real thinker)

Add in a lot of words borrowed from other languages:

- Gospazha (Russian for 'mistress', like 'mister')
- Gospodin (Russian for 'mister')
- Dosvedanyuh (Russian for 'goodbye')
- Goy (Russian for non-Jew)
- cobber (Australian equivalent of British 'mate')
- tovarisch (Russian for 'comrade')

... and you wind up with a polarizing book. I very much understand if you find this writing style unbearable and can't be bothered to read it. If it still grates on you by the end of **PART 1: THAT DINKUM THINKUM**, it likely never will. But I respect Heinlein's dedication to the craft -- it can't be easy to write an entire book like this!

## Characters

I'll get out ahead of the criticism and air my biggest complaint about this book: Heinlein's treatment of women. There are some strong female characters, like the oldest wife in the Davis clan, a wise, powerful matriarch. But every female character is static. Heinlein spends far, far too much time describing the appearance of women -- especially notable given how _little_ time he spends describing the appearance of men.

We can make some small excuses for this: the narrator, Manuel, was born on Luna, a forced-labor penal colony with an incredibly small population of women. This has resulted in a society that values and protects women, sometimes at the expense of female autonomy. Manuel's narration reflects this attitude.

But there are times when Heinlein's treatment of women isn't linked to the narrator. Instead, it just feels sexist and dated: for instance, when Manuel remarks that Wyoming "is more man than women some ways." A dominant attitude in 1966, perhaps. But it feels _ick_ by modern standards.

- Mike/Michelle/Mycroft/Adam Selene: see the above "AI" section for more detail, but this is easily the best character in the book. It grows. It learns. It schemes. It makes mistakes. It learns from those mistakes. Highlight of the book, for me.

- Manuel O'Kelly Davis: main character, exhibits minor growth, but honestly Manny was a pretty good guy to begin with and most of his 'growth' is simply being a good friend and family member. A good guy to get a beer with.

- Professor Bernardo De La Paz: The kind of idealist you want planning the broad strokes of your revolution. A 'rational anarchist' who shamelessly steals revolutionary ideas from Thomas Jefferson. Surely an entertaining guy to drink a beer with.

- Wyoming Knot: Woefully underutilized female character, after the first few chapters. Gave birth to a malformed child, so she divorced her husbands and swore off having her own children. Instead, gets her money from bearing children after artificial insemination, apparently a well-paying job on the Moon. Sadly we don't get any insight into the emotional trauma that sort of employment must unleash on a person. Once she marries into the Davis line family, she blends in entirely with the rest of the wives. A modern retelling of this story from Wyoming's perspective, digging into the untold female story of the revolution? _Wye Knott?_

## Summary

_The Moon is Harsh Mistress_ isn't perfect. But for 1960s sci-fi, it is incredibly good. Heinlein even manages to tackle AI, a notoriously thorny subject, rife with cheesy tropes and plotting pitfalls. Most importantly, like any good sci-fi, _TMiaHM_ is about people and civilization. With some basic modifications, you could tell a very similar story in early 19th-century Australia, or Victorian Bermuda, or Singapore Island, or Louisiana, or the [present-day (!!!) Islas Marias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islas_Mar%C3%ADas). Because great sci-fi is about ideas and people, not cool technology and space.

I would pay good money to watch a longform TV series about this revolution, hopefully fleshing out the female side of the story in a lot more detail. The story still holds up and it would be really easy to create at least 3 seasons of content, one for each section of the book. Maybe someday, once all the big streaming companies have finally realized that re-making existing movies and TV shows is kind of boring.

PS: Today marks the birth of a friend's child. They didn't quite make the July 4th date I was hoping for, which would have coincided nicely with a book review of _TMiaHM_, which features a Lunar Declaration of Independence signed on July 4th... but I guess July 13th is fine, too. Happy zeroth birthday, Chip!
