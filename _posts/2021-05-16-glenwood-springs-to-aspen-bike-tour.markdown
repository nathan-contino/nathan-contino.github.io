This weekend, I tried something new. I took a bike ride down the Rio
Grande trail all the way from Glenwood Springs to Aspen. Meg and I
spend a lot of time biking around the Denver metro area, which is
generally amazing. While the Denver metro area has a fantastic
network of bike paths, pleasant flat grades, almost perfect weather
for biking year-round, and a great view of the (distant) front
range, it's still biking in a city. We regularly have to avoid
broken glass in streets, constantly have to navigate around tourists
on electric scooters, and *always* have to lock our
bikes up if we so much as glance away from them.

The Rio Grande trail provides the benefits of tax-dollar-supported
paved paths with the beauty of not being surrounded by cookie cutter
suburban nightmares and constant traffic. And the beauty of being
surrounded by... well, beauty. You'll see in a second when we get
to the pictures. Anyway, Meg and I haven't gotten out of Denver
for a few weeks, so we decided to drive up into the mountains and
do an overnight bike trip. We haven't taken any lengthy trips yet,
so we wanted to stay somewhere where we'd pass a town every ten
miles or so in case one of us experienced a bike problem we
couldn't handle with a multitool and a lot of grit. Which,
naturally, happened in the very first mile. The Rio Grande trail
seemed perfect: a safe place to park in Glenwood Springs, a whole
town to explore and book a hotel in to recover overnight, and not
so much distance that we'd hit our limits.

# Denver

Our first day started at 5 AM. Meg and I woke up, guzzled a
smoothie Meg generously blended before going to sleep, and made
a couple of Aeropresses worth of coffee. By 5:50, we were on
the road. After 3 hours on I-70, including a drive through the
[highest altitude point and longest tunnel in the US Interstate Highway System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_Tunnel) and some
gorgeous views of
[Glenwood Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenwood_Canyon),
we arrived in Glenwood Springs.

# Glenwood Springs

*the bikes looking fresh while Clem gets left behind in the RFTA parking lot*

By 9 AM, we'd finished our
last-minute bathroom break at a nearby Starbucks, and I
encountered my first Bike Problem. My rear rack, which I
had just put on the night before, fell... backwards.

![starbs]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/the_journey_begins.jpg){:width="100%"}
*probably should have noticed the angle of the rack while taking this photo*

Not really off the bike, but dragging behind the bike.
Ten minutes of finagling and
Christmas Story-dad-level-swearing and we got the rack
just secure enough to start our ride. Unfortunately,
the southern side of Glenwood Springs doesn't have a bike
shop, so we decided to persevere to Carbondale to seek out
a tiny torque wrench.

# Carbondale

*biking south towards the majestic mount sopris*

Thirty minutes of slightly nervewracking riding down a
*very* pretty section of bike path later, we arrived at
Carbondale. One wrong turn in Carbondale brought us
directly to a very friendly
(bike shop)[http://www.basaltbikeandski.com/] where I
quickly got my rack sorted out pro-bono. To the employee
that helped me out: I hope your first house lease works
out well!

![basalt bike and ski]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/thanks_bike_shop.jpg){:width="100%"}
*basalt bike & ski to the rescue!*

After wrapping up the bicycle repairs, Meg and I headed
over to a [well deserved meal](https://www.silocarbondale.com/).
Pretty much everything about our breakfast experience
was perfect. There were crabapple trees in full bloom right
in front of the restaurant, the workers were extremely
friendly, and (most importantly) the food was, to put
it lightly, absolutely bomb. They:

- quickly found us a spot on their very cute patio space
- served a macchiato that was appropriately sized, with
  an appropriate ratio of milk to espresso
- served an americano that actually managed to convey
  floral light-roast flavors
- balanced egg, hashbrowns, some extremely flavorful
  cheese, and green chili with just enough tomatillo
  in my breakfast burrito
- paired Meg's french toast (made with homemade bread,
  of course) with a raspberry compote topping that
  made me reconsider my decision to ever waste my time
  on jam again

![french toast]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/french_toast.jpg){:width="100%"}
*the best french toast Meg has ever had 10/10*

![burrito]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/burrito.jpg){:width="100%"}
*one helluva delicious breakfast burrito 9.7/10*

Nicely done, SILO. We'll be back.

![art path]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/art_path.jpg){:width="100%"}
*art path through carbondale*

By 11:15, Meg and I were back on the Rio Grande trail
heading through Carbondale. We were treated to some
very fine views of [Mount Sopris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sopris)
as we rode our way through the
[Rio Grande ARTway](http://www.carbondalecreativedistrict.com/artway).
I couldn't help but appreciate a downtown public
space that provides a full bike repair station, a
small singletrack bike trail, a gravel bike trail,
a paved bike trail, and public parks with picnic benches.

![riding out of carbondale]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/riding_out_of_carbondale.jpg){:width="100%"}
*bikey boi*

Once we made our way out of Carbondale with
fully-functional bikes and full stomachs,
the scenery transitioned from scrubby high desert plains
to incredibly green farmland nestled between gently sweeping
hills. At times, it felt like we were biking through
the Austrian Alps -- compared to the last 6 months
of brown grass in the Denver metro area, I finally started
to appreciate the whole "hills are alive" bit from The
Sound of Music.

![baby cow]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/baby_cow.jpg){:width="100%"}
*this baby cow's cuteness level was off the charts*

At 12:05, we passed yet another lovely green farm, this
time with a small group of longhorned cows grazing in it.
Meg went crazy as some calves caught her eye and we spent
another 15 minutes taking pictures of the cute cows and
getting weird glances from passerby. Personally, I think
it was worth it for the very cute calves. Eventually I
peeled Meg away from the animals and we made our way
through a very welcome spray of farm sprinkler water
as temperatures made their way into the 70s. We also
passed a classic Colorado sight -- a downtown core of
a schoolhouse and a couple of brick walkups that must
have lost their residents when the road they were built
on transitioned into a major highway.

![meg in the valley]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/meg_in_the_valley.jpg){:width="100%"}
*meg's enthusiasm for farms knows no bounds*

# Basalt

![horse bridge]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/horse_priority_bridge.jpg){:width="100%"}
*honestly pretty disappointed with the lack of horses on the trail*

By 1, we reached the town of Basalt. Everyone waved at
us as we biked through town, including the cops. With
a track meet and a baseball game going on, the world
actually felt pretty normal for the days of COVID.

![beer rest]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/beer_and_rest.jpg){:width="100%"}
*enjoying a brew on the river*

At 1:45, Meg and I stopped for a beer and a break at
a little fishing spot before the final stretch to Aspen.
Kudos to [Breakside Brewery](https://breakside.com/)
for a hazy IPA that still tasted good after 7 hours
out of the fridge. Thank goodness they distribute
to some beer stores in Denver -- they're based in
Portland, Oregon.

![harmony]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/harmony.jpg){:width="100%"}
*donkeys, goats, sheep, horses, and cows all living in harmony*

At 2:05, another animal-based distraction yanked Meg
off her bike. Donkeys, goats, cows, sheep, AND horses
all grazing together in the same field. Maybe there is
hope for the future after all!

![train house]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/train_house.jpg){:width="100%"}
*nate, mandarb, & pullman - name a better trio, I dare you*

At 2:20, we passed some trains that now appear to
be used as housing. Presumably these trains used to
roll over the railroad that
[used to be where the Rio Grande trail is now](https://www.rfta.com/trail-information/), so... sorry trains, for taking
over your territory.

![aspen view]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/aspen_first_glance.jpg){:width="100%"}
*so many shades of green and the first glimpse of aspen snowmass*

2:30 granted us our first view of the Aspen/Snowmass
ski hills, still largely blanketed in snow. Of course,
we didn't just stop for that -- our path took us right
through an enormous cluster of prairie dog holes.
Fortunately, we didn't
[catch any bubonic plague](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/17/us/bubonic-plague-colorado/index.html),
but with the number of prairie dogs we see in this
state, it's only a matter of time.

![prairie dog]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/prairie_dog.jpg){:width="100%"}
*one of the hundreds of prairie dogs we spotted. sneaky lil bois*

At 3, a triple whammy:

- beautiful views of the Roaring Fork river passing
  through a gorge just before Aspen
- ridiculously fancy second houses for rich people
- views of planes taking off and landing at Aspen's
  airport

Who doesn't love gorges, multimillion dollar homes, and
watching planes take off? After a brief break, we
hopped on an optional "soft surface" section of the trail
to test our mettle on gravel, and while we did see a lot
cut small animals, I mostly just missed out on views of
the gorge. We eventually made our way back to the paved
section of trail, which transitioned into non-optional
gravel about 100 feet later. Luckily there were good
sights of the airport, a water treatment plant, some
dangerously loose-looking rock faces, and a small
waterfall on the side of the trail to distract us.

The last stretch of trail into Aspen was a killer --
at that point, the constant uphill grade very much
had us in the mood for a beer and a burger. We kept
trucking for the last few miles of tree-covered trails
into Aspen and checked our bikes into the hotel, then
headed out to investigate the town (and the prospect
of a beer and a burger).

# Aspen

![aspen]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/aspen_slopes.jpg){:width="100%"}
*wandering around aspen left a strange desire to walk away from the people and up the mountain*

Aspen is possibly the stranges town I have ever visited.
From the park benches (regularly oiled!) to the bus stop
bathrooms (spaceous, lockable, and cleaner than the
bathrooms at my old office in NYC), everything is really,
really nice. There are nice houses, nice streets, nice
sidewalks, a *lot* of nice parks, and nice views of the
surrounding mountains. Even the temperature was nice.
But at its core, the town felt a bit hollow. Businesses
that looked cute on the outside turned out to be soulless
overpriced resort town crap, and service employees all
had the shell-shocked look of folks who have to deal with
a lot of crap from the natives. Maybe it was just a weird
off-season vibe since a lot of businesses were temporarily
closed for the spring, but overall it just made me feel
strange. In Glenwood Springs, Carbondale, and Basalt, it
felt like everybody waved and said hello -- not so much
in Aspen.

We ended up walking around town until we found a decent
beer to split over a bag of Goldfish. The best we were
able to find was a craft cider and a can of bubbly wine.
Who doesn't love the life of luxury in a fancy town?

# The Ride Back

![downhill]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/near_aspen.jpg){:width="100%"}
*realizing that the entire trip on day 2 would be downhill*

Meg and I woke up at 6 AM and lollygagged until almost 7
before hopping back on the trail. After our afternoon
experience in town, we decided not to stick around for
complimentary breakfast.

![praise the sun]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/praise_the_sun.jpg){:width="100%"}
*the sunlight starts right on the outskirts of aspen. coincidence? i think not. praise the sun. praise ra.*

We were treated to an absolutely gorgeous crisp morning.

![prairie dog paradise]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/prairie_dog_paradise.png){:width="100%"}

Blue skies, prairie dogs, and nary a human to be seen
on the bike trail once we made our way out of Aspen proper.
Lots of prairie dogs, chipmunks, and folks walking their
*pairs* of dogs. That's right, in the span of 2 hours
we saw:

- a pair of bernese mountain dogs
- a pair of corgis
- a pair of golden retrievers

Those happen to be the three best kinds of dog, so I'm
going to go out on a limb and say that folks in Basalt
have great taste in dogs.

![turkey]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/turkey.jpg){:width="100%"}
*birb in a field, birb in a field, i am just a birb in a field*

We also saw a cluster of wild turkeys wandering across
the bike path, which really puts the size of turkeys
into perspective. It would have been even more
impressive if we didn't regularly see a neighbor's pet
turkey on our walks around Denver.

![aspen view]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/aspen_view.jpg){:width="100%"}
*looking back at aspen snowmass and wishing it didn't cost extra on the IKON pass*

![church]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/church.jpg){:width="100%"}
*church-house conversion in basalt*

We ended up eating breakfast at a cute cafe in downtown
Basalt around 8:45. The coffee wasn't the best, but the
breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich were magnificent.
They could use some pointers on steaming milk.

![old basalt trail]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/old_basalt_trail.jpg){:width="100%"}
*sully & mandarb ready to take on basalt*

On our ride back, we mostly stuck to the Rio Grande trail,
but took the opportunity to deviate onto other trails
to spice things up when we could. Our ride back included
stints on the Emma and Old Basalt/Snowmass Trails,
and neither disappointed. It seems the valley has
solid bike infrastructure *everywhere*. Even the secondary
trail had a tunnel under the highway in an adapted
drainage tunnel!

![bridge]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/bridge.jpg){:width="100%"}
*cute bridge on the old snowmass/basalt trail*

On our way back to Carbondale, we also took the opportunity
to ride along a dirt road that's parallel to the Rio Grande
trail. I haven't had much experience riding on packed dirt
roads before (I've mostly ridden on pavement, concrete, and
gravel in the past), so it was nice to find that our bikes
feel just as great on dirt as they feel on pavement.
Especially in Colorado, it opens up a ton of touring
opportunities!

![lizard]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/lizard.jpg){:width="100%"}
*artway lizard in carbondale*

At 10:50, we got back to Carbondale and admired a fantastic
lizard sculpture that we somehow missed on the ride out.
By 11, we were back at SILO, enjoying a fantastic:

- nitro cold brew (properly done, so it was even a bit sweet)
- iced chai (they nailed the balance of sweet and spicy)
- lemonade (they nailed the balance of sour and sweet)
- burger (all I can say is that it's the best burger I've had
  in Colorado, and even gave the burger at
  [Tørst](http://www.torstnyc.com/) a run for its money)
- turkey club (blueberry saba is a bold choice, but it
  panned out for sure. And the bread was a texture I've
  never had before -- almost biscuity)
- hashbrowns with green chiles and red onions (crispy bois)

![truss]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/truss.jpg){:width="100%"}
*nice little beach area between carbondale and glenwood springs*

At 12, we enjoyed a quick pit stop at Colorado's
[oldest truss bridge](https://www.denverpost.com/2011/05/13/colorados-last-through-truss-bridge-gets-new-life-near-carbondale/),
the Satank bridge. If the sun hadn't disappeared behind
some clouds, I definitely would have dipped into those
chilly waters for the memories -- maybe I'll wait for
June, though.

![hills]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/white_and_red_and_green.jpg){:width="100%"}
*"it's like they ran out of red paint and just had to switch to white"*

At 12:53 PM, we finally got back to Clem, our obnoxiously
orange Crosstrek. After a 10 out of 10 weekend of
bike adventures, I can safely say that we'll be back soon
to check out some of the other bike paths, dirt roads,
and gravel routes in the Glenwood Springs area. Some friendly
folks on the trail even recommended some routes to us at a
stop!

![glenwood canyon]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/glenwood_canyon.jpg){:width="100%"}
*i-70 between vail and glenwood springs is absolutely wild*

# Epilogue

![fin]({{ site.url }}/_images/may_21_bike_trip/fin.jpg){:width="100%"}
*a happy meg knowing that casey brewing is just minutes away*

After our journey, we enjoyed another well-earned beer at
[Casey Brewing](https://caseybrewing.com/), a world-renowned
source of spontaneous fermentation beers. I've had their
beers before, but it was pretty great to finally stop by the
Casey taproom and see their (very cute) setup.

I also saw Lauren Boebert on the street in Glenwood Springs,
which was... well, I guess it's nice to see representatives of
Congress on the street, talking to people. That's all I can
really say. And yes, she was carrying.

As a final stop of our journey, Meg and I swung by
[Westbound & Down](https://westboundanddown.com/), who've made
some really well-executed sour beers with my favorite beer
bar in Denver, [Goed Zuur](https://goedzuur.com/). Their
taproom in Idaho Springs (which is also a restaurant... and
a coffee shop?) was surprisingly spacious, and their
green chili cheese fries were a welcome snack after our
long, early morning of biking. I also appreciate the fact that
Idaho Springs has pedestrianized their main strip, so it's
actually pleasant to walk around. Their beer list was a
little sparse for my liking, but we'd been meaning to visit
for close to a year now, so it's good to finally get around
to that.
